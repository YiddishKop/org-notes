* Synchronization

  [Q] How to get around the thread scheduling by OS?

  [A] *the easiest way* to fix this, is called *synchronization*

      but synchronization has some inevitable drawbacks:
      1. too much synchronization will make parallelism slower
      2. 因为 synchronization 每次只允许一个线程访问，所以这就把 parallel 退化为 sequential 了。

  [A] *the good way* is use Futures and Actors --- structure our code in ways that avoid race conditions as much as possible

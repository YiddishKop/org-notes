what is a tensor, it's a n-dimensional arrays.

graphical model enable you to build complex models in terms of small and simple
opreations. Also make gradient extremely simple, automatic differentiation.

another way of thinking about a tensorflow graph is that eahc opreation is
fn that can be evaluated at that point.

This a neural network with one hidden layer, upside is a computational graph
in tensorflow .

variables: b w, they are stateful, and can be retained accross multiple
executions of a graph.

*It is important to remember  that variables in graph like b,w are still opreations*

*all of your nodes in the graph are operations*

*when you evaluate these nodes you get their values*

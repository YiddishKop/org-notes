<p>The quarter is over, and I&rsquo;m back at home with the family. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll return
for a few weeks contracting at <a href="http://stremor.com">Stremor</a>. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been reading this
week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138534"><strong>Aaron (1994)</strong></a> attacks the idea of treating the preferences and values
of an individual as stable as more of an &ldquo;axiom of religious faith&rdquo; than a
&ldquo;defensible scientific hypothesis&rdquo; (6). He supports approaches such as that of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape">Epstein and Axell</a>, which avoid unrealistic oversimplified models of
utility that Aaron claims have plagued microeconomics for too long.</li>
  <li>Bertrand Russell gives the <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NcJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tr0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6918%2C334589"><strong>10 commandments of &ldquo;true liberalism&rdquo;</strong></a> &mdash;
worth a read for any student, learner, thinker, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1983/5/v7n3-3.pdf"><strong>Yandle (1983)</strong></a> gives an outline of his catchy concept of &ldquo;bootleggers
and baptists.&rdquo; For those unacquainted with the bridge between public policy
and economics (read: me), this is a really enlightening read.</li>
  <li>Rudolf Weinstock&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html"><strong>The Lisp Curse</strong></a> makes a poignant statement about
software development: the people developing may be as affected by their tools
as they affect their environment. Technology affects our social behavior.</li>

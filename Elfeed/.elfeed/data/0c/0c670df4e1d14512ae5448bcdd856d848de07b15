<pre><code>primitive-undo: Unrecognized entry in undo list undo-tree-canary
</code></pre>

<p>This is <strong>really bad</strong> and can cause loss of work if you didn't happen to save the newest version of your work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since I never use the branching undo tree functionality, is it possible to use emacs linear undo with evil mode?</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: I've tried setting <code>(global-undo-tree-mode -1)</code> directly after <code>(evil-mode 1)</code> which disables undo tree, but redo (Ctrl-R) doesnt work after doing this.</p>

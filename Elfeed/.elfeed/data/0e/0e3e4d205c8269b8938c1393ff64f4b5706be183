<p>Cardinal John Newman acknowledges a problem familiar to any student in this
quote from his seminal work, &ldquo;The Idea of a University.&rdquo; Every student is well
acquainted with that intimidating specter&mdash;the constant worry of the weight of
his own reading, the sheer pressure imposed by the great minds of &ldquo;tributary
generations.&rdquo; The student is assailed throughout his undergraduate years with
assignments on the landmark publications of each field. The classics professor
encourages the student to read Homer, while Plato and Descartes are urged on him
by his philosophy lecturer. From the department of economics come aggressive
recommendations of Hayek, Keynes and Friedman. It is easy, and indeed common in
this environment, to feel overwhelmed by the heights we are expected to climb in
order to stand on the proverbial &ldquo;shoulders of giants.&rdquo; In our default
shortsighted mode of vision, it may appear simpler and more efficient to merely
speed through our reading tasks, satisfying short-term goals while neglecting
the long-term. It is indeed tempting to sacrifice those lofty aims when
suffocating under the weight of past minds, their words forever channeled at us
through book after book, article after article. To skim just a few pages or to
read for raw information rather than for meaning is an impulse indeed often too
attractive to resist.</p>

<p>Newman&rsquo;s essay urges students to avoid this kind of fervent fact-gathering,
however, and instead remain &ldquo;above [their] knowledge.&rdquo; His most central
recommendations are brief and firm: he suggests that &ldquo;we must generalize, we
must reduce to method, we must have a grasp of principles, and group and shape
our acquisitions by means of them.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> He refers to this entire process concisely
by employing a metaphor of <em>digestion:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The enlargement [of mind] consists, not merely in the passive reception into
the mind of a number of ideas hitherto unknown to it &hellip; it is a <em>digestion</em>
of what we receive, into the substance of our previous state of thought; and
without this no enlargement is said to follow.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This &ldquo;digestion,&rdquo; according to Newman, is a necessary condition for any actual
improvement in intellect&mdash;or, in his own terms, for any &ldquo;enlargement of mind.&rdquo;
The process at a high level is clear enough: a student wishing to best benefit
from his reading must always synthesize the new facts he acquires with his
existing knowledge, aggregating a cohesive whole of mastery rather than a mere
conglomeration of pieces of information. But Newman does not sufficiently detail
concrete methods for engaging in this &ldquo;digestion.&rdquo; He does not provide practical
suggestions for applying these ideas to any learning practice, let alone reading
in particular. It is the purpose of this paper to show that a reading practice
combined with a slow, thoughtful extraction of passages from the texts being
read satisfies the requirements for Newman&rsquo;s process of &ldquo;digestion.&rdquo; The method
of integrated reading and writing we examine is by no means novel: it has
existed since at latest the era of the Roman Empire, albeit under many unrelated
names.</p>

<p>It will first be useful, then, to unify the various overlapping terms for the
products of the practice discussed in this essay. The most well-known names
still extant in discourse today are the <em>florilegium</em>, the <em>hypomnēma</em>, and the
commonplace book.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> These media, though published and discussed under distinct
names, are actually quite similar in their methods of composition and the
results of their use. This essay will focus on the properties and consequences
of the practice at the intersection of these three traditions, which will be
termed the &ldquo;commonplace book&rdquo; for convenience and consistency. This &ldquo;commonplace
book&rdquo; under discussion refers to a personal book containing collections of
quotations and passages from texts or dialogues of particular value or interest
to its owner. The book might also contain marginalia referring to the passages
quoted, or a prologue stating the intention of the author or summarizing the
texts included.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Commonplace authors composed these books during their
reading or immediately after completing a text.</p>

<p>Historical support for this practice of reading and writing intertwined appears
as far back as ancient Rome. Seneca, a major figure in the Stoic school of
philosophy, stresses in his works the importance of &ldquo;continuous writing.&rdquo; He
employs several oft-used analogies, first portraying scholars as bees traveling
from flower to flower and gathering the nectar of knowledge at each:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We also, I say, ought to copy these bees, and sift whatever we have gathered
from a varied course of reading &hellip; then, by applying the supervising care
with which our nature has endowed us &hellip; we should blend those several flavors
into one delicious compound.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seneca portrays the collection of ideas as an extremely discerning process, far
from the simple mechanical procedure of facsimile that the description of
commonplacing might first suggest. We must imitate the bees, using our
&ldquo;supervising care&rdquo; to select the nectar most especially sweet to us&mdash;those
passages which send the clearest and most striking messages. Seneca affirms that
writing is the most reliable method for gathering these notes. The various ideas
which readers collect from books, he says, must be &ldquo;reduced to concrete form by
the pen.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> This conviction appears in equal force among medieval writings
under the name <em>florilegium</em> (literally, the &ldquo;collection of flowers.&rdquo;)<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> John
of Wales, a 13th century writer, quotes Seneca directly as he explains his own
practice of compiling quotes and forming <em>florilegia</em>. He works to collect
&ldquo;examples worthy to be imitated, which are all so many flowers.&rdquo; John stresses
the process of selection in his own explanation, emphasizing that readers must
make selections carefully, avoiding &ldquo;poisonous errors&rdquo; that could otherwise
enter the collection of quotes.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Several centuries later, Erasmus recommends
to his readers a specific method of processing and organizing what they take in
from books. After a student has prepared separate categories for the storage of
ideas, he should proceed to read with &ldquo;a view to extrapolating.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Indeed,
for these authors throughout history, reading without simultaneously writing was
likely not a serious activity in any amount. As they struggled under the weight
of their reading, the commonplace book served as a natural recourse for
distilling and simplifying the massive input which these writers had to
manage.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Reading in this style was an eminently practical
engagement&mdash;students combed through texts with the explicit purpose of
extracting useful morsels of information.</p>

<p>The result of such extraction was a collection surprisingly personal and unique.
This simple act of rewriting and annotating quotations by hand produced a unique
work which evidenced the individuality of its owner. In selecting and arranging
choice extracts, a reader would construct a personalized image of his
studies&mdash;a concrete projection of how the texts had affected his own ideas and
beliefs. Kevin Sharpe gives a view of how this practice was paralleled in early
modern England:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]hough what the compiler copied was extracted from a common storehouse of
wisdom, the manner in which extracts were copied, arranged, juxtaposed,
cross-referenced or indexed was <em>personal and individual</em> &hellip; The compiler
essentially rewrote, fashioned a new text, which was anything but common,
indeed was unique.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sharpe suggests that the way in which any given commonplace author chose to
unify heterogeneous entries from distinct sources was necessarily personal and
idiosyncratic. As Michel Foucault names the practice in his work &ldquo;Self-Writing,&rdquo;
this &ldquo;subjectivation&rdquo; of new knowledge&mdash;the deliberate process by which a
learner would attempt through transcription and further writing to blend the
lessons from a text into his existing worldview&mdash;was absolutely crucial for
proper understanding and assimilation.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> This same concept of subjectivation
is cited in Newman&rsquo;s work as a necessary condition for proper &ldquo;digestion&rdquo; of
information. Newman claims that such a process of fusion of ideas makes &ldquo;the
objects of our knowledge subjectively our own.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> The process of commonplace
book composition would yield something wholly unique, composed of equal parts
original text and individual impression. The result was so personal, in fact,
that Francis Bacon proposed it would be of little use to other readers: &ldquo;I think
first in general that one man&rsquo;s notes will little profit another, because one
man&rsquo;s conceit doth so much differ from another&rsquo;s; and also because the bare note
itself is nothing so much worth as the suggestion it gives to the reader.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>
A man&rsquo;s &ldquo;conceit&rdquo; derived from any text was personal and unique. In the end,
what readers remembered from their texts was what the works meant to them&mdash;the
&ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; they felt&mdash;rather than the exact content of any given paragraph.
By Bacon&rsquo;s claim, then, a commonplace book contained extracts which, as a whole,
were of higher value to their creator than a simple sum of the values of the
book&rsquo;s parts. The artifacts of these Baconian &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; could exist in the
form of short pieces of commentary, or simply render themselves in the way
commonplace writers chose to give certain quotes extra prominence in their
books. In allowing original text and impression to mix, whether consciously or
not, readers produced a unique view of their own exploration and learning
progress. These personal extracts would prove to be of real use in the weeks,
months, or years after a reader finished a text, when the passages could be
revisited.</p>

<p>Gathering passages and notes from various works allowed readers to greatly
simplify the otherwise burdensome task of memorizing the most important lessons
they derived from their texts. By perusing their commonplace books, they were
able to not only recall the exact content of their past favorite quotes but also
experience again the impression which the text had made upon them. Through our
modern lens, it is evident that these revision activities were crucial to proper
memorization and assimilation of the ideas most important to a reader. There is
much scientific evidence today, in fact, which supports this idea of periodic
review of important reading content. The phenomenon known as the <em>spacing
effect</em> is particularly relevant to this rereading practice. According to the
spacing effect, learners who sustain consistent review of content over long
periods of time can memorize more effectively than those who commit to large
amounts of memorization work in a single sitting.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> The tradition of the
commonplace book encouraged this kind of regular spaced review, which modern
psychology research has proven to be an effective method for memorization.
Historical support for this revision activity is just as plentiful: nearly every
author who suggests the composition of a commonplace book also stipulates its
constant inspection and revision. The most critical ideas were to be
consistently reread until finally learned by heart. This recall practice, which
slowly brought the most crucial passages of one&rsquo;s reading closer to a
subconscious level, was of obvious utility for students.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Historical sources
show that recall aided not only students but learners of all ages. Aspiring
essayists and professional writers alike benefited in methodically memorizing
the many short bodies of text which they found relevant or especially profound.
A typical citizen could deploy these memorized commonplaces in conversation or
correspondences. Writers could include their own preferred quotations in their
compositions on any topic.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> This tradition was an exceptionally useful
practice for readers of any sort to memorize the passages they held most dear.</p>

<p>While recall was the most visible and straightforward end in revisiting these
collections, the commonplace book also served as a tool to instill proper values
in its owner. Every commonplace book had its own distinctive selections,
carefully gathered and uniquely recorded by their respective authors. Foucault
draws a strong contrast between the product of this writing practice and other
more superficial methods of collection, which he claims yield nothing more than
&ldquo;memory cabinets.&rdquo; Commonplace books were vessels, rather, for the most
meaningful and crucial ideas that readers wished to &ldquo;deeply lodge in the
soul.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> To return to this book and rediscover this collection of
commonplaces was a wholly solemn and private task. It offered readers an
opportunity to relive those solitary moments of deep insight which they had
experienced with texts in the past. Furthermore, it allowed them to see their
various transcriptions not as isolated morsels of wisdom but as small parts of a
larger system. Each quote and comment rested in between many others, and readers
who returned to their books for a certain passage could not avoid comparing this
entry with those nearby. This is Newman&rsquo;s digestion forced into action: it is
the unification of new ideas with old beliefs. It trained the reader to never
contemplate any given concept, in Newman&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;without recollecting that it
is but a part [of a larger picture of knowledge], or without the associations
which spring from this recollection.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> This process of revision and
subsequent synthesis helped the reader to piece together a more uniform self.</p>

<p>Commonplace books had their highest end, then, in helping their owners to build
their own characters in the most literal sense: the composition of the book
paralleled the construction of the character. Readers strove through their
commonplace books to synthesize the heterogeneous opinions they acquired through
their reading into a single cohesive statement of identity. Of course, this
deliberate integration of different ideas could not be accomplished without
significant modification. Seneca compares the gathering of ideas to the chemical
process of digestion, wherein no food can benefit us unless it is also changed
in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is what we see nature doing in our own bodies without any labor on our
part; the food we have eaten, as long as it retains its original quality and
floats in our stomachs as an undiluted mass, is a burden; but <em>it passes into
tissue and blood only when it has been changed from its original form</em>. So it
is with the food which nourishes our higher nature,&mdash; we should see to it
that <em>whatever we have absorbed should not be allowed to remain unchanged,</em> or
it will be no part of us. We must digest it; otherwise it will merely enter
the memory and not the reasoning power.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again we return to the abundant metaphors used throughout history in discussion
of this practice. The &ldquo;food which nourishes our higher nature&rdquo; arrives to
readers in the form of well-crafted sentences, aligned in sequence across
sections, chapters, and volumes&mdash;distilled and compressed knowledge, printed
onto lifeless paper. It is our task, suggests Seneca, to revive these ideas,
enliven them: that is, to analyze, transcribe and repeatedly modify them until
they are wholly our own, persisting in their changed state in our private
thoughts. In transcription and subsequent rereading of these copies their owners
could not avoid contemplating exactly how the passage affected them rather than
simply viewing the old ideas in a dry, objective manner.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> The process of
revisiting the book was intrinsically reflective and introspective. It was the
catalyst for a &ldquo;personal construction of meaning,&rdquo; says Sharpe<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>&mdash;a solemn
and meditative activity of recollection and review through which the reader
could &ldquo;[constitute] his own identity.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> It is this active review and
constant inquiry into past lessons learned that Newman promotes as a requirement
for &ldquo;digestion.&rdquo; He portrays the process as one of deliberate &ldquo;locomotion&rdquo;: a
&ldquo;gravitat[ion]&rdquo; toward some cohesive personal worldview.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>

<p>Such constant gravitation brought readers ever closer toward a destined balance
in knowledge and identity through reading, writing, and meditation on that
writing. The result, to engage once more in the profusion of metaphor present
among all the writing on this topic, was a &ldquo;choir&rdquo; of past ideas, each memorized
and carefully aligned to fit the theme of the whole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let our minds aim at showing the finished product, but conceal all that has
helped to produce it &hellip; take a choir: it consists, as you see, of many voices
and yet all those voices form a unity &hellip; although individual voices do not
emerge, the voices of all are heard and from a number of different sounds
there comes a harmony.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mind as constructed by the commonplace book was purely a synthesis of the
most prized thoughts of the past. After some slight modification, each idea fit
in as a voice in a choir, such that the group as a whole produced a single
harmony. While this &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; is always cited as a beneficial result of
commonplacing, sources across history disagree on the related consequences of
this practice of collection. Mary J. Carruthers observes that the medieval
citizen may have treasured the activity to a fault, seeing himself as precisely
the product of his readings and no more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One sometimes gets the impression that a medieval person &hellip; could do nothing
(especially in duress) without rehearsing a whole series of exemplary stories,
the material of their experience built up board by board in memory &hellip; so that
even in moments of stress the counsel of experience will constrain a turbulent
and willful mind.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a relatively radical perspective of the effects of commonplacing.
Readers were so extremely dependent on their personal books, Carruthers
suggests, that without those collected quotes we would see unleashed &ldquo;turbulent
and willful mind[s],&rdquo; unbridled and unanchored from their safe havens built up
from the writings of past authors. Some opponents of the practice criticized
this extreme form of the idea. They claimed that those who relied solely on
accepted ideas of the past doomed themselves to weak, impersonal
argumentation.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> This contention has merit, but only serves to refute the
particular conception of the practice that Carruthers presents. The portrayal is
indeed unfair to the majority of commonplace book authors, who were not so
absolutely dependent on their books. As we have already learned, commonplace
books were defined by their more primary use in deliberate reflection and
introspection rather than by their purpose as a simple reference. This
particular form of study did not yield some sort of unstable debater completely
dependent on his past notes, but rather, in Seneca&rsquo;s words, a unique
intellectual child of the authors of quotes gathered.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> A commonplace writer
was the product of many disparate (and perhaps even disagreeing) voices, whose
precepts were each tweaked and re-aligned by the writer to form a holistic and
coherent compilation. The diligent commonplace book owner was not a lifeless
portrait of the inputs,<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> but rather a living and breathing entity, carrying
treasures of accumulated wisdom and prepared to deploy them in situations both
trivial and novel.</p>

<p>In such novel situations the benefit of commonplacing becomes even clearer. To
many writers of the past, those readers who worked to establish concrete moral
codes through their commonplace books proved to be the most resilient in the
face of new or resurgent problems. These types of problems require a stable,
robust mind: one which can rationally evaluate the root of an issue and resolve
it using a combination of past knowledge and new constructions. This thinking,
says Foucault, is patently impossible for a reader who does not maintain control
over the many distinct ideas he derives from his texts. &ldquo;Endless reading&rdquo;
without deliberate writing interspersed would lead to the &ldquo;great deficiency&rdquo; of
<em>stultitia</em>&mdash;a state of &ldquo;mental agitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;distraction&rdquo; in which the
reader is overwhelmed by the massive amounts of input which he must process,
without the assistance of any external tools.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> A program of intense reading
which omits these aids would do little for a student but fill his mind with a
hodgepodge of facts and likely contradictory ideas. Newman&rsquo;s essay claims that
readers who simply hoard knowledge &ldquo;they have not thought through&rdquo; are thus
&ldquo;only possessed <em>by</em> [it], not possessed <em>of</em> it; nay, in matter of fact they
are often even carried away by it, without any volition of their own.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> The
function of the commonplace book from this perspective, then, is to allow
readers to establish an intellectual anchor&mdash;some definite collection of
precepts and past arguments against which new ideas and new problems can be
compared&mdash;so as to not be &ldquo;carried away&rdquo; by the weight of their own reading.</p>

<p>The product of commonplacing was a cohesive composition far greater than the sum
of its parts, a physical realization of the identity and intellect of its
discerning author. The practice yielded after years a mind rigorously trained
and exceptionally prepared, forever supported by this anchor of precepts
deliberately assimilated and consciously reaffirmed over time. The commonplace
author was a perfect image of the product of Newman&rsquo;s &ldquo;digestion.&rdquo; He used his
book to process and memorize important information from the texts he
encountered, while simultaneously working to construct a unique, robust self.
Over the years the author built an image of himself through his collection, and
benefited from a clear view into his own intellectual past.</p>

<p>This is not to say that items once penned in a commonplace book were made
eternally true. On the contrary, the book offered detailed images of a reader&rsquo;s
past thoughts and beliefs, many of which he was likely to see invalidated in the
future. These collections merely provided a snapshot of the reader&rsquo;s worldview
of the past, which upon revisiting he could choose to reinforce or deny using
new evidence or personal experience. In returning to past extractions wielding
new evidence or ideas, the author continued that same process of synthesis and
modification begun during the book&rsquo;s creation even after its pages had been
filled. As such a projection of the past, the book made for the reader a nearly
physical companion out of his former self&mdash;a reification of his earlier
thoughts with whom he could converse and debate.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> These images of a past
self were invaluable to a commonplace writer in providing an image of which
intellectual landscapes he had visited and where he had yet to explore. The book
was a depository, moreover, into which the suggestions triggered by each
individual work could be assembled, mixed, rearranged, and investigated as a
cohesive whole. In this way, the commonplace author found a method for managing
his knowledge inheritance&mdash;for lodging deeply in his soul those precepts most
important to him, and thus learning to master the weight of past generations.
<em>Imperat aut servit:</em> with the commonplace book at hand, the reader was finally
free to choose.</p>

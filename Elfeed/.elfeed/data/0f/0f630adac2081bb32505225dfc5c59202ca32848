<p>
If you read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs</a> or follow some Emacs bloggers on twitter, you’ll
have noticed a proposal for an Emacs stack exchange site was launched
a couple of weeks ago. The commitment rate of the proposal was <a href="http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/17913/28113">nearly
record-breaking</a>, and now it has entered <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">private beta</a>.
</p>

<p>
If I understand correctly, the private beta will only last a couple of
weeks, but members are allowed to send out invites. So, if you missed
the commitment stage but you’d like to help, drop a comment here.
</p>

<p>
Even if you don’t think you are expert enough to give good answers,
asking questions and voting is a great help already. The focus during
this stage should be <b>difficult</b> and <b>interesting</b> questions. So don’t
go easy!
This stage sets the tone of the entire website.

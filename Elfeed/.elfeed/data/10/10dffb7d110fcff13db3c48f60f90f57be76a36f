When writing prose, I find auto-completion to be more of a distraction
then an aid. However, my field of research involves much
repetition of some annoyingly long words, such as <i>“thermalization”</i> or
<i>“distinguishability”</i>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of completely disabling auto-complete, I've found it useful to dial it
down a notch, while still letting it trigger on these monstrosities.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">ac-auto-start</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">company-minimum-prefix-length</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">endless/config-prose-completion</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">"Make auto-complete less agressive in this buffer."</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">setq-local</span> <span class="nv">company-minimum-prefix-length</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">setq-local</span> <span class="nv">ac-auto-start</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'text-mode-hook</span>
  <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">endless/config-prose-completion</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
This will offer completions based on previously typed text, but only when I
stumble while typing a long word.

<p>
Do you use any kind of tab completion for writing prose? It seems
<code>company-mode</code> has an Ispell back-end, has anyone ever tried that?</p>

<p>
I can’t write a whole new post this week due to being buried under some
once-in-a-lifetime stuff. Still, the Monday post is one I refuse to miss, so I
leave you today with an update on last weeks post.
</p>

<p>
Running tests on file save really didn’t work out for me, because I’ve configured
CIDER to save files before loading them when I use <code>cider-load-file</code>. So the
tests were always being run against outdated definitions.
</p>

<p>
The fix is simple, though. Just run the tests after <code>load-file</code>. CIDER even had
a hook for that already. I also made the minor-mode global (even though it only
applies to clojure buffers) so that it’s easier to disable everywhere with a
single command.

The new code is in the <a href="/test-driven-development-in-cider-and-emacs.html">original post</a>.</p>

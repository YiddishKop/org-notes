  <li><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html"><strong>&ldquo;I, Pencil&rdquo;</strong></a> trumpets the self-organizing wonders of the free market
in parable form. Not one single person on this earth, it claims, knows how to
produce a pencil from scratch. It takes millions of people working together to
accomplish such a feat. Moreover, all these people working together toil not
in the interest of global pencil production rates but rather in the interest
of feeding their families. The output is a mere side effect!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>

how free-market solutions can solve real social problems. I&rsquo;ll have to read
more about this &ldquo;bleeding-heart libertarianism&rdquo; that he discusses.</li>

economics discourse operates. The bleeding edge debates don&rsquo;t always happen in
peer-reviewed journals anymore &mdash; they&rsquo;re also present on the blogs of
economists across the web!</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4165235"><strong>&ldquo;On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B&rdquo;</strong></a> gives some
interesting examples of perverse incentives in public policy and management.</li>

what our generation has been taught about success (and how our visions
actually play out in the long run). This topic merits substantial discussion,
but I&rsquo;ll need to think more before putting forth any ideas on this medium.</li>

<p>During the export process, <code>org-export-dispatch</code> calls <code>org-open-file</code> which in turn calls <code>find-file-other-window</code>, which in turn causes part of the problem by calling <code>find-file-noselect</code> with its <em>nowarn</em> argument set to <em>nil</em>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure of the best way to go about this, but I believe the solution would be to modify the <code>yes-or-no-p</code> statement, lines 2040 - 2055 of ...<em>/emacs/26.0.50/lisp/files.el.gz</em>:</p>

<pre><code>        ((yes-or-no-p
          (if (string= (file-name-nondirectory filename)
                   (buffer-name buf))
              (format
               (if (buffer-modified-p buf)
               "File %s changed on disk.  Discard your edits? "
             "File %s changed on disk.  Reread from disk? ")
               (file-name-nondirectory filename))
            (format
             (if (buffer-modified-p buf)
             "File %s changed on disk.  Discard your edits in %s? "
               "File %s changed on disk.  Reread from disk into %s? ")
             (file-name-nondirectory filename)
             (buffer-name buf))))
         (with-current-buffer buf
           (revert-buffer t t)))))
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<p>such that when the buffer is <strong>not</strong> modified and <code>(global-)auto-revert-mode</code> is set, then automatically return <code>yes</code> without prompt.</p>

<p>Not sure if this should be filed as a bug?</p>

<p>When I compile the corresponding <em>tex</em> file that is generated as part of the <code>org-export</code> process, <code>(global-)auto-revert-mode</code> is respected, and the <em>pdf</em> buffer is automatically reverted.</p>

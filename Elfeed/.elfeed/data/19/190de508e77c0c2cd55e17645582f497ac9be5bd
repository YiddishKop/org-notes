I've just released Paradox version 2.0. If you've been following the blog, you
already know this features the ability to do background upgrades. Below is a list
of other features.
</p>

<p>
However, I'd first like to say this release requires an Emacs version of at
least 24.4. <code>package.el</code> changed a lot in that release, and the trouble of
supporting two separate versions was keeping me from writing new features. I may
implement backwards compatibility if I see people asking for it.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <code>paradox-execute-asynchronously</code> variable </dt><dd>Set to <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> depending on
whether you want this feature.
</dd>
<dt> <code>paradox-upgrade-packages</code> command </dt><dd>Upgrade everything, wherever you are.
Combines well with the above.
</dd>
<dt> <code>paradox-after-execute-functions</code> variable </dt><dd>A hook run after every
transaction. Remove functions from it to streamline your experience, or add
your own functions to extend functionality. For instance, if you don't like
the new <code>*Paradox Report*</code> buffer, you can prevent its creation by removing
the relevant functions from the hook:
</dd>
</dl>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">remove-hook</span> <span class="ss">'paradox-after-execute-functions</span>
  <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">paradox--report-buffer-print</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Better interaction </dt><dd>Now, when you hit <code>x</code> in the Paradox Menu to execute a
set of installations and deletions, the buffer narrows to display only
those packages (see below). Much nicer than the usual message in the echo
area.
</dd>

These are the main changes. You can also <a href="/view-the-change-log-for-packages-before-upgrading-with-paradox.html">view package commit lists</a>, but that's
been the case for a while.

<p>My OS is Ubuntu 16.04, I have installed texlive-full, and I have installed AucTex and org using the Emacs package manager.</p>

<p>I have been trying to follow the first example in this guide:</p>

<p><a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-preview.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">latex preview example</a></p>

<p>I have put in my <code>.emacs</code> file the single line</p>

<pre><code>(setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program 'imagemagick)
</code></pre>

<p>I have the imagemagick package installed in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Yet when I try to see the first example by pressing <code>C-c C-x C-l</code>, I get this error message:</p>

<pre><code>org-compile-file: File "/tmp/orgtex32228nYH.pdf" wasn't produced.  Please adjust 'imagemagick' part of `org-preview-latex-process-alist'.
</code></pre>

<p>When I press <code>C-h v</code> I can inspect the variable, but I have no idea what to change...</p>

<p>Looking in <code>/tmp</code> there is no corresponding <code>.log</code> file, only a <code>.tex</code> file, which doesn't reveal any error.</p>

<p>Can anybody please help me?</p>

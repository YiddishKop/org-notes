Are you a Chromebook user or thinking of becoming one? Are you a die-hard
Emacser who needs to see it run even in your browser for no good reason (no
judgement)? Either way, Emacs has you covered. Thanks to the efforts of Pete
Williamson (and friends), there is now an Emacs port for Chromebook and Chrome.

If that spikes your interest, you should read <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/118416397954909331171/posts/8dt2sM8YeeM">his post about it</a> on Google Plus,
which provides installation instructions, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEUBUkVDQR1oDx18ZSM39PlbQBvlmNMwOQBhbSm_9mc">list of known issues</a>, and some tips
on how to make the most of it. In short:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable Chrome’s <a href="chrome://flags/#enable-nacl">Native Client flag</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nacl-development-environm/aljpgkjeipgnmdpikaajmnepbcfkglfa">NaCl Development Environment</a> from the Chrome web store.</li>
<li>Launch the app and wait for it finish setting everything up. YMMV, but I had
to restart the app at this point.</li>
<li>Run <code>emacs</code> at the terminal you’re given (and celebrate!).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/118416397954909331171/posts/8dt2sM8YeeM">his post</a> contains a lot more information, including his email so you can
report bugs or file suggestions. Although I did run into a couple of small bumps
with the DevEnv app, the Emacs executable ran just fine and performed admirably.

Pete has been doing this as his 20% project &#x2014; in which Google employees take
20% of their time to work on something else. If you follow the steps above, you
may notice that it uses Emacs 24.3, already two minor versions behind the latest
stable. That’s because 24.3 was the latest release back when he started this
endeavour.

If you’re wondering how hard it was, he talked about it on FOSDEM last year and
you can have a glance at the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/emacs_and_elisp_on_the_chromebook/attachments/slides/797/export/events/attachments/emacs_and_elisp_on_the_chromebook/slides/797/FOSDEM_Building_Emacs_with_NaCl.pdf">slides</a> for this talk. It was harder than I would
have expected and clearly took some patience. Of course, all of the code is
publicly available under the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/webports/+/master/ports/emacs/">webports project</a>. It’s basically a shell script and
a patch file, so it’s worth a look if you’re curious.

Once you learn paredit, you really can’t go back. Even when you’re not editing
lisp you crave for the ease of manipulating everything as balanced sexps.
Although that’s (sadly) not always possible, you can still hack your way into a
bit of guilty paren-pleasure in pretty much any editing session.

While not all programming languages are lisps, most of them do have brackets and
quotes. And paredit should have no problem moving you forward-up out of a C
string, wrapping curly brackets around a work in LaTeX, or even splicing out a
pair of parenthesis in plain prose.

Below are a few keys I find useful pretty much everywhere, so I’ve allowed them
to take over the global keymap.

<p>also as a bonus (since this is used to create as ingredients table for a cookbook) it would be great to be able to define the columns in advance so that the amount|type|ingredients are nicely separated. for example take this list</p>

<pre><code>3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons white vinegar 
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, melted
cooking spray 
</code></pre>

<p>if i mark this as a region and issue <code>org-table-create-or-convert-from-region</code> this is the result</p>

<pre><code>|     3/4 | cup         | milk        |         |      |        |     |       |         |
|       2 | tablespoons | white       | vinegar | (%or | better | yet | lemon | juice%) |
|       1 | cup         | all-purpose | flour   |      |        |     |       |         |
|       2 | tablespoons | white       | sugar   |      |        |     |       |         |
|       1 | teaspoon    | baking      | powder  |      |        |     |       |         |
|     1/2 | teaspoon    | baking      | soda    |      |        |     |       |         |
|     1/2 | teaspoon    | salt        |         |      |        |     |       |         |
|       1 | egg         |             |         |      |        |     |       |         |
|       2 | tablespoons | butter,     | melted  |      |        |     |       |         |
| cooking | spray       |             |         |      |        |     |       |         |

<p>as you can see it got the amount (1/2) and the unit (cup) right yet the actual ingredients is cut into several columns</p>

<p>i dont really know how to deal with this. is there a more intelligent way of auto directing the conversion to split it the correct way?</p>

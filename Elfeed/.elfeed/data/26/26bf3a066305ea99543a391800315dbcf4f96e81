<p>It&rsquo;s finals week here at Stanford. I&rsquo;m just finishing up a research paper
entitled &ldquo;<em>Imperat aut servit</em>: Managing our knowledge inheritance&rdquo; which will
likely be published here after the quarter has ended. Apart from writing, I&rsquo;m
beginning to think about further independent research. I&rsquo;ve been investigating
patterns in Romanian etymology and am considering engaging in some sort of
formal analysis. Hayek is also still on my mind &mdash; I&rsquo;ve been wondering about
how I can model a particularly interesting statement in &ldquo;The Use of Knowledge in
Society&rdquo; using genetic programming. More on all of this later, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>For now, here are the interesting parts of my (very sparse) reading this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/27740557">Hoxby (2009)</a></strong> details a trend of &ldquo;re-sorting&rdquo; among college applicants
over the past decades which has led to a more efficient &ldquo;matching&rdquo; between
high-aptitude students and high-selectivity schools. She demonstrates that
per-student resources at highly selective universities have skyrocketed due to
this higher efficiency: as better-matched students arrive at top-tier
colleges, they demand the support they have been looking forward to.
Furthermore, the paper reveals a curious trend in the financials of premier
American colleges: the average student only pays around 20% of the value of
the resources offered to him, while the remainder is repaid by alumni
donations.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/view?isbn=0262550253"><em>Growing Artificial Societies</em></a></strong> by Epstein and Axtell has been useful
as I think about developing a system to model problems in economics (see
introduction).</li>

Install JDEE! Ok, maybe that’s an overstatement. JDEE is far from simple, and it
hasn’t been able to keep up very well since Java 1.4. However, thanks to Stephen
Leake &amp; folks, that might be starting to change. <a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/">JDEE is now on Github</a>, and it
could definitely use your help.

Stephen has already been updating the code base for the recent Emacs versions,
and other people have shown interest in this as well. There are already some
<a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/issues">productive discussions</a> going on in the issues, and some of those items are
things anyone could do. So if you like Emacs and you use Java, now this is a
great chance to give something back.

However, if JDEE is not to your taste, don’t forget you have <a href="https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim">emacs-eclim</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode">malabar-mode</a> too. I’ve never used malabar-mode myself, but last time I had to
deal with Java I gave eclim a try and it worked pretty well. You do need an
eclipse server running in the background, but once you do it facilitates a good
amount of features.

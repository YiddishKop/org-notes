<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/Nameless">Nameless</a> is an Emacs package for hiding namespace prefixes in elisp code. It
is a short and simple minor-mode that changes the display, without changing the
contents of the buffer. Using it is as simple as turning it on, there’s no need
to change your package in any way.

<a href="/introducing-names-practical-namespaces-for-emacs-lisp.html">Nine months</a> ago I introduced <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/names">Names</a>, a package that allows you to write elisp
code inside a namespace. Since then, I’ve used it on two of my packages without
issues (as have several other Emacs hackers) and it’s been delightful. I’ve been
hacking elisp for several years now, but stripping away all those namespace
prefixes really makes it more pleasurable to write and read code. 
</p>

<p>
Still, there’s no denying that it’s a bit heavy-handed. It’s quite a large
library that your package has to depend on, and it changes the way you write the
file itself, which means it messes with anything from <code>grep</code> to <code>find-function</code>.
Nameless, on the other hand, hooks onto <code>font-lock-mode</code> and changes the way
symbols are displayed. This means it doesn’t interfere with any other tools you
might use for code management or navigation. At the end of the day, it tries a
lot less and therefore does a lot more.
</p>

<p>
Nameless is available from <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/nameless.html">GNU Elpa</a>. To give it a try, just <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<code>package-install</code> it, and turn on the minor-mode wherever you want.

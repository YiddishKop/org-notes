<p>
Since the previous post on <a href="/big-things-to-expect-from-emacs-25.html">Emacs 25</a> has been well received, I've decided to
start a series on the topic. It's time to get off the rocking chair, step off
the porch and onto the sidewalk, and start walking towards that ominous “25” on
the horizon. Unlike the <a href="/big-things-to-expect-from-emacs-25.html">birthday post</a>, we're not here to discuss possibilities,
but to meet and greet every new feature that's already implemented in Emacs
<code>master</code>.
</p>

<p>
This time, we stick to the style of the blog. Short posts listing a single
feature, or two at most. It's going to be a long walk, so we might as well take
it one step at a time.

When [in] query-replace [&#x2026;], typing <kbd>M-p</kbd> will now show
previous replacements as "FROM SEP TO", where FROM and TO are the original text
and its replacement, and SEP is an arrow string defined by the new variable
<code>query-replace-from-to-separator</code>. [&#x2026;]
</p>

This is actually rather cute.<br  />

The arrow is intangible, so it really doesn't get in the way. You can edit
either sides of the prompt, switch them around for a kind of “undo” effect, and
you can even delete the arrow to turn the prompt into a regular <i>FROM</i> prompt.
</p>

<p>
If you keep cycling back through all the previous replacements, you will
eventually be offered replacements in the old format (just <i>TO</i> and then just
<i>FROM</i>).

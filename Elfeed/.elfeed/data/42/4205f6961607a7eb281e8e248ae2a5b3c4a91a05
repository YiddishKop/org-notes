<p>I am using <code>emacsclient -a '' -nw --socket-name=$TTY</code> where <code>TTY=$(basename tty)</code>. I use emacs in the terminal and this gives a unique daemon for each terminal session. </p>

<p>If I start the daemon by running <code>emacsclient</code> with no arguments, it starts and everything works fine. However, if I start it by running <code>emacsclient file</code>, it locks down. It opens the scratch buffer and then gets frozen. The only way to fix it is to <code>kill -9</code> the daemon process and to restart it without opening a file. </p>

<p>I am using emacs 24.4 compiled with <code>--without-x</code> with Mac OS X in iTerm 2. You can get the exact build of emacs I am using with <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">conda</a> <code>conda install -c asmeurer emacs</code>. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I found after disabling flyspell (commenting out <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles/blob/29f6c3ae344a784cb536ddbc07bf53b3a234bbd2/.emacs#L614-L637" rel="nofollow">these lines</a> from my .emacs), it fixes it. It still hangs on the scratch buffer for a few seconds, but then goes to the file. I suspect it has something to do with starting the hunspell process. </p>

<p>Hello world! Well, <a href="/2014/sunday-links-6/">I had a feeling</a> things would get quiet around here in
the early-quarter crunch, but I failed to predict just how much I would lose
control. The details aren&rsquo;t especially important, but suffice it to say that I
drove myself slightly crazy in these first few weeks. I&rsquo;m just resurfacing now,
and can affirm that my idea of &ldquo;living intentionally&rdquo; has gained entire
unforeseen layers of meaning. I&rsquo;m tracking my progress in January in-depth in a
private log, and the relevant details will likely surface here come my winter
quarter review next month.</p>

<p>For now, let&rsquo;s focus on the reading! I&rsquo;ve kept up my reading habits over these
past few weeks, though my focus has shifted from online posts and articles to
books.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://studiahumana.com/pliki/wydania/In%20Praise%20of%20Passivity.pdf"><strong>&ldquo;In Praise of Passivity&rdquo;</strong></a> has been making quite the splash in
libertarian circles recently. Michael Huemer sums up decades of
pro-free-market discourse and asks us to consider the forgotten wisdom of
doing nothing &mdash; of not &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; for the causes we &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in, and of not
pushing current social theory into undue prominence.</li>
  <li>Michael Nielsen&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/"><strong>&ldquo;How the Bitcoin protocol actually works&rdquo;</strong></a> is a
fascinating intuitive explanation of the innards of the Bitcoin protocol. This
post added much to my understanding of the system, even though I had already
read (and thought I understood) the original Satoshi paper.</li>
  <li>Friedrich Hayek contrasts two strongly opposed schools which both take the
same name in <a href="http://mises.org/books/individualismandeconomicorder.pdf"><strong>&ldquo;Individualism: True and False&rdquo;</strong></a>. He scorns the
individualism which he labels as &ldquo;Cartesian rationalism,&rdquo; which supposes that
a society must promote the search for those pinnacles of human reason who can
serve as &ldquo;wise legislators&rdquo; to lead the rest of us. Hayek puts forth his own
idea of individualism, a measured and exceedingly humble recognition of any
individual&rsquo;s fallibility and the consequent need for free interaction and
group consensus in a political system.</li>

harsh critique.</li>

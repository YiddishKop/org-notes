<p>Happy New Year! I&rsquo;m really excited about what 2014 has in store, and interested
to see how a consistent blogging practice might make things better.</p>

<p>This concludes the final week of Stanford&rsquo;s winter break. I&rsquo;ve been working hard
to make the most of my remaining relatively-free time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I made an effort to
read more seriously this week (mostly on more topics in economics), alongside
beginning work on several projects that are important to me, including
<a href="/2013/german-2014">learning German</a>, <a href="/2013/biphasic-sleep">experimenting with biphasic sleep</a>, researching
possible summer work opportunities, and writing a book (post forthcoming!).</p>

<p>There will likely be an enormous time crunch in these first few weeks as I
re-adjust to the school environment and &ldquo;shop&rdquo; for classes. Expect it to be
quiet around here for a bit.</p>

friendly introduction to &ldquo;libertarian paternalism,&rdquo; the strategy of
constructing choice architectures in a way that counters the harmful effects
of acknowledged cognitive biases and allows individuals to better pursue their
own aims. The first several chapters are absolutely worth a read.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C8N4FNK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00C8N4FNK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blog0cbb-20"><strong><em>The Motivation Hacker</em></strong></a> is a fantastic condensed presentation of the
best points of <a href="http://lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a>-style instrumental rationality: it is packed
with useful &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; which can be used to ramp up motivation and productivity.
This is not a self-help book but rather a descriptive work: an image of the
most promising techniques applied successfully in a single person&rsquo;s life. A
great quick read without the usual condescension or absolute focus on a single
method that usually comes in this self-improvement genre.</li>
  <li>Russ Roberts hosts an
<a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/12/richard_fisher.html">outstanding EconTalk interview with Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher</a>.
Fisher clearly and plainly states his opinion on the Fed&rsquo;s support of &ldquo;too big
to fail&rdquo; banks and exhibits without restraint his strong disapproval of
current monetary policy. I&rsquo;ve listened to this three times already and will be
taking notes on it as I listen again on the plane ride back to Stanford. Pure
gold. (See also <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/12/31/dallas-feds-richard-fisher-talks-tbtf-on-econtalk-ows/">Mathbabe&rsquo;s summary and response</a>.)</li>
  <li>Alex Gaynor gives <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/2013/dec/30/about-python-3/">a realist&rsquo;s view</a> of the state of Python 3, pointing out
that only 2% of PyPI package downloads are for version-3 applications. He
suggests that Python 3 features be backported to a 2.8 release.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/12/bad-for-you-techno-panic-timeline"><strong>&ldquo;These New-Fangled Books Will Doom Us All!&rdquo;</strong></a> is a fun infographic
that exposes thinkers since the 15th century decrying the horrible social
effects of new technologies. Critics of technology have lamented the impending
destruction of society due to new media since the printing press, but we still
seem to be doing okay.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;bunnie studios&rdquo; <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554">pries open some SD cards</a> and reveals some surprisingly
insecure designs.</li>
  <li>Ben Bernanke gives what may be <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20140103a.htm">his final speech</a> as Fed chairman.</li>

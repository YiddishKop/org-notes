<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el#sx--stack-exchange-for-emacs">SX.el</a>, the awesome Emacs client for the <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">StackExchange network</a>, has been stable
and happy for many months now, and it’s about time I mentioned it here. We have
put considerable effort into making the interface intuitive, teaching you how to
use it without the need for explanations. In fact, it would probably be a
disservice to the package for me to post a tutorial, so I won’t just yet.
Instead, I’ll just urge you to give it a try.
</p>

<p>
After installing it from <a href="http://stable.melpa.org/#/sx">Melpa</a>, the only thing you need to do is authenticate
with <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>sx-authenticate</code>. Once that is done, you’re ready to invoke any of
the entry commands.
</p>

<p>
The main command is <code>sx-tab-all-questions</code>. But that’s so many letters, we
simply must to bind it to a key. And if you read the post title, you know <a href="/launcher-keymap-for-standalone-features.html">where
I’m going</a> with this.

<p>
Before signing off, I will also bring to your attention the magnitude of the
<code>SX.el</code> feature set. This is not just a cute toy that lets you browse or search
questions. The client has so many features it could take the website itself in a
fight. Voting, editing, commenting, answering, asking, deleting, inbox viewing,
and source code font-locking are all things that just popped into my head. And
that’s without mentioning a host of Emacs-oriented features like tabbing through
buttons, or folding (hiding) comments like org headlines.

I’m probably saying too much already, let’s leave some content for future posts.

<p>Following up on last week&#8217;s recommendation to go see a dentist for A-, I took A- to her first dentist appointment. It turns out that she has enamel hypoplasia, a developmental defect that results in incomplete enamel. It&#8217;s associated with a higher risk of cavities, so we&#8217;ll be extra careful about brushing her teeth and minimizing sweets. It may or may not affect her permanent teeth. We&#8217;ll see. Anyway, it&#8217;s just something to deal with.</p>
<p>The first session of the parent advocacy workshop was an overview of the 6-week series, definitions of advocacy, and group sharing. It got me thinking about what A- could learn from how I advocate for her. I don&#8217;t know what kinds of accommodations we might need, but I hope to be able to take a collaborative approach to continuous improvement. I&#8217;d love it if A- absorbed the message &#8220;We&#8217;re all different, and it&#8217;s good to adapt our environment to reduce barriers and help us&#8221; rather than &#8220;I have to be treated specially because of my limits&#8221;. I&#8217;m still going to tap all the resources I can, but that&#8217;s because I like learning. :)</p>
<p>The Let&#8217;s Get Started session focused on visual routines, and I posted <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2017/03/notes-from-the-lets-get-started-parenting-series/">a few notes on that and previous sessions</a>. I&#8217;ve been making an effort to use more visual props when talking to A- or transitioning between activities: a diaper, the potty, her high chair, the sleep sack…</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working on pointing, too, as I realized we hadn&#8217;t emphasized that and it&#8217;s usually a 12-month milestone. She&#8217;s starting to get the hang of it, gesturing towards things she&#8217;s interested in and sometimes even sort of pointing with a finger.</p>
<p>A- practised crawling up and down the carpeted stairs to the second floor. She sometimes needs a reminder at the top of the staircase to go down legs-first, but is otherwise surprisingly capable. We decided to skip installing baby gates for now since I&#8217;m with her, and she seems to like having stair practice time. She works so hard!</p>
<p>We went to the Junction Family Resource Centre and the Parenting and Family Literacy Centre. A- is getting better at playing independently. I had a bit of time to chat with the facilitators and the other parents, and even to flip through the red flags guide by the City of Toronto.</p>
<p>A- figured out a new sound (&#8220;Nai&#8221;) and seemed to recognize the words &#8220;crumple&#8221; and &#8220;cat&#8221;.</p>
<p>I did a little consulting, too. I added a categorization feature, wrote a tutorial, and helped transfer some more of my code.</p>
<p>I replaced my credit card and reactivated my library card, so that&#8217;s all sorted out now. I also updated my Ledger to correctly tally up my investments, explored tools for converting bank data, and created a net worth summary report. I needed the investment records in order to double-check the book value for my taxes, which I started preparing in a VM. I also set up incremental backups with borgbackup and a VM for testing my blog backups, yay!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to have focused time for process improvement. Looking forward to more tweaking!</p>

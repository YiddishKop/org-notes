<p> I just downloaded the latest version <code>mu</code>/<code>mu4e</code> and rebuilt it on my system. That’s a pain because Apple insists on shipping a very old version of Emacs<img alt="&lt;img src=" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/2014.png" /><img alt="—" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/2014.png" style="height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt;apparently to avoid GPL 3<img alt="&lt;img src=" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/2014.png" /><img alt="—" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/2014.png" style="height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt;and <code>mu4e</code> won’t build because it thinks Emacs is too old. I have to figure out how to get around this every time it comes up. This time I just changed the makefile to point at the proper Emacs in <code>/Applications</code>. </p>
<p> In any event, this is a good time to mention Charl Botha’s post on <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2017/02/07/mu4e-0-9-18-e-mailing-with-emacs-now-even-better/">mu4e 0.9.18</a>. There are a some nice enhancements that Botha describes, which I’ll let you read in his post. One of the nice things about the post is that he provides his <code>mu4e</code> configuration. That’s really handy if you’re just setting <code>mu4e</code> up and want a working, reasonable configuration. He comments it well so you should have no problem adjusting it to your liking. </p>

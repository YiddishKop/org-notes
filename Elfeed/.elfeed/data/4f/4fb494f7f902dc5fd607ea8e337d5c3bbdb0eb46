When I'm opening file via emacsclient and closing buffer - I'm successfully returning to terminal, BUT iterm2 window has no focus, so I have to click on window to gain it. I tested behaviour inside tmux session and outside - the same behaviour. </p>

<p>My command to run emacsclient:</p>

<pre><code>emacsclient -c -a \"\" $argv
</code></pre>

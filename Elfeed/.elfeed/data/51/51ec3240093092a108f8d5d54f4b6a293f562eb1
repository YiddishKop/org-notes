<p>I'd like a constrained file picker, presumably using a pop-up or in the minibuffer, or autocompletion within the text field but the <code>directory</code> and <code>file</code> data types in my widgets give basic text fields instead; this means a lot of copying and pasting.</p>

<p>Is there a convenient way to choose between non-constant values and/or to modify widgets on the fly beyond <code>widget-value-set</code> (I would need to populate a list of files when the selected directory changes)? Can packages like ido, helm, icicles etc. be configured to provide autocompletion in Customize widgets?</p>

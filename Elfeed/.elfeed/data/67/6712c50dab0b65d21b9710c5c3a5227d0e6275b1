<p>An example would make things clearer -- assume I have a file that looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>#+EXPORT_TEMPLATE: mytemplate
* Some headline
:PROPERTIES:
:foo: 1234
:bar: 5678
:style: bold
:END:
Body of first headline.

* Another headline
</code></pre>

<p>Now say (just as an example) I want it to be the case that when I export this document, it first creates the following (temporary) org-mode document and exports it:</p>

<pre><code>* Some headline
The value of bar is 5678, and
Body of first headline.
foo is *1234*.

* Another headline
</code></pre>

<p>And let's assume that the *1234* above was in bold because the :style: property was set to bold.</p>

<p>I think you can get the idea from this -- I want a flexible way of creating a template (which can be referred to within an org-mode file) that influences how the exported document looks based on certain rules and substitutions of property values.</p>

<p>Is something like this possible?  Maybe there's a solution using org-babel?</p>

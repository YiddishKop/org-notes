how eliminating consistent overt racist behavior is not the same thing as
not being a racist. I think it&rsquo;s very good to clearly designate these other
less obvious moral violations. As a result, we&rsquo;ll be forced to recognize our
own &ldquo;moral mediocrity&rdquo; (Eric&rsquo;s phrase). The unacceptable alternative is to
pretend we are morally perfect and not leave any room to keep learning. This
is the default state of the non-critical modern liberal.</li>

<p>Can pdf-view-mode be used as a replacement for doc-view-mode generally, or does it have to be "tool" by tool?</p>

<p>In either case, is it necessary to edit emacs source to use pdf-tools in gnus, eww and orgmode or are their system-wide settings that can be employed?</p>

<p>--- Features of pdf-tools here for convenience; see <a href="https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools" rel="noreferrer">github site</a> for details ---</p>

<ol>

<li>Can add text annotations, and highlighting, underlining, and the like</li>
<li>Can create imenus for pdf parts</li>
<li>Can treat several pdfs as a single "virtual" pdf</li>

</ol>

  <li>I like plants. Plants are nice. But are they conscious? Do they think?

  <li>How is cognitive function distributed across the human brain? A meta-study
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756684/">applies a simple entropy measure</a> over distributions of activations for
brain regions across tasks. The findings: both cortical and subcortical
regions vary greatly in their task diversity. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortativity">assortativity</a> measure
also varies greatly across cortex; some regions are functionally cohesive,
while others seem to yield a patchwork of different functions.</li>

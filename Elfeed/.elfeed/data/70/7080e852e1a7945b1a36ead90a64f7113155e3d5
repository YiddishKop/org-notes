<pre><code>@ 
&lt;&lt;anyChunkName&gt;&gt;=
R code goes here
@ %def 
</code></pre>

<p>I had to delete that leading <code>@</code> each time writing an R chunk to appear like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;anyChunkName&gt;&gt;=
R code goes here
@ %def 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
I am using ESS vesrion 15.09-2 patched</p>

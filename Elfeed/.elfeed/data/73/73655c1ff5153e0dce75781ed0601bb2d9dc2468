The dot-dot-dot ellipsis that org-mode uses to indicate hidden content is
usually just fine. It’s only when you’re staring at a document where every line
is a folded headline, that you start to feel like they’re a little too much “in
your face”. I have a few org files with thousands of lines and hundreds of
headlines, and changing that <code>...</code> to something shorter greatly reduces visual
clutter.

The more straightforward option is to use a proper ellipsis character (the same
effect with a third the length).

The one I’m currently using is a cornered arrow.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-ellipsis</span> <span class="s">"⤵"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

Other interesting characters are <code>▼</code>, <code>↴</code>, <code>⬎</code>, <code>⤷</code>, and <code>⋱</code>.</p>

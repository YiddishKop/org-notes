<p>It was A-&#8216;s birthday last week. W- made so much food for the party with his family, including a devil&#8217;s food cake with coconut-pecan icing (recipes from the Joy of Cooking) and two rotisserie chickens. Yum yum yum! Everyone cooed over A-, especially when she gave our cat Luke a big hug. She was totally uninterested in the cake, but she loved having yogurt.</p>
<p>The timing worked out pretty well. The weather was nice and sunny. A- got sick with her first serious cold the day after the party: sniffles, sneezes, fever, diarrhea, even a bit of throwing up and spitting up. She eventually got over it, although we did end up calling Telehealth to ask what we should do. W- also bought two thermometers: a forehead thermometer for easier measurement, and a large-display thermometer for general use.</p>
<p>W- went back to work this week, so we&#8217;re getting the hang of new routines. Between that and us being under the weather, I was mostly focused on childcare and sleep. We&#8217;ll see what normal life will be like when we recover.</p>
<p>I took A- to the pediatrician for her 12- month vaccines. At 8.015 kg, she&#8217;s above the 15th percentile curve for weight, and generally doing fine aside from that cold. I got a prescription for her next conformer, a form for blood tests, and a note about scheduling A-&#8216;s next ultrasound (keeping an eye on her liver hemangioma).</p>
<p>The EnzoDate glasses I ordered for A- arrived, and we&#8217;ve been practising wearing them for a second or two at a time. One of the demo lenses has some print on it, but it&#8217;s still fine for the purpose of getting A- used to glasses. Eventually I&#8217;ll get her proper glasses with polycarbonate lenses. I checked local stores for prices for fitting the glasses we just got her with proper lenses, and things seem to be set up so that it&#8217;s cheaper for me to buy the frame with included lenses than to get lenses fit into this frame. We&#8217;ll check the numbers again when she can keep these on.</p>
<p>Language: A- seems to be working on &#8220;ha&#8221; and &#8220;ta&#8221; sounds, and she&#8217;s also babbling a lot more now compared to last week.</p>
<p>I had a morning appointment for dental cleaning. A- was still asleep by the time I needed to head out, so she stayed at home with W-. They were both perfectly fine. They had breakfast and everything. It was my first time going outside the neighbourhood without A-. I felt so unusually light that I couldn&#8217;t help but jog part of the way home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been trying to find a place that would let me do two units of dental scaling so that I could come three times a year while still having things mostly covered by W-&#8216;s insurance. Fortunately, they agreed to my request. Whee! Let&#8217;s see if this works out.</p>
<p>My dad was in the hospital for an operation, and is now recovering. Yay medicine!</p>

<code>org-mode</code> has a very useful command, <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-time-stamp"><code>org-time-stamp</code></a>, which helps you insert
dates from a calendar. So you can quickly type <kbd>C-c . RET</kbd> to insert
<code>&lt;2015-10-05 Mon&gt;</code>, for instance. These time-stamps are used by Org in a variety
of ways, so they are wrapped in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> to make them easy to parse. The downside
being that they look less than optimal when exported.
</p>

<p>
I was bit by this again today while updating the <a href="/donations-donations-donations.html">post on donations</a>, and I
finally decided to look for a way to fix it. Of course, <code>org-mode</code> is nothing if
not configurable, so the answer wasn’t very far away.

<p>
The loyal readers might notice how similar this is to the second <code>lambda</code> we
used for <a href="/embedding-youtube-videos-with-org-mode-links.html">exporting Youtube links</a>. Org is quite consistent in its use of export
filters.
</p>

<p>
The above is enough to remove the surrounding <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, but we can still make it
better. The <code>YYYY-MM-DD weekday</code> format isn’t commonly used in prose, so let’s
switch that as well.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">setq-default</span> <span class="nv">org-display-custom-times</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;;; Before you ask: No, removing the &lt;&gt; here doesn't work.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-time-stamp-custom-formats</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"&lt;%d %b %Y&gt;"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">"&lt;%d/%m/%y %a %H:%M&gt;"</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
As a bonus, this format will also be used to display time-stamps in your
<code>org-mode</code> buffers. If don’t want that, you can let-bind the
<code>org-display-custom-times</code> variable when calling the export function, instead of
setting it globally.
</p>

<p>
<b>If any of this doesn’t work for you</b>, you might need to update your Org
package. Fortunately, <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org.html">Org is on GElpa</a>, so anyone can do that with <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<code>list-packages</code>.

<p>However, doing this in Spacemacs (in evil mode, of course) would create a new buffer, which I have to kill manually by typing three characters: <code>&lt;space&gt; b d</code>. This is quite inconvenient for me, because I'm a inexperienced programmer who needs to execute programs <em>very</em> frequently while debugging.</p>

<p>How to make execute a program more efficiently in Spacemacs? For example, I want close the output window/buffer in one keystroke. I'm also glad to know if I can replace <code>:mit-scheme &lt; xxx.scm</code> with some key bindings.</p>

<p><code>M-x volume &lt;RET&gt; q</code> -> still in volume-mode (in the minibuffer)</p>

<p>In contrast, after a C-Z, it does work:</p>

<p><code>M-x volume &lt;RET&gt; C-Z q</code> -> not in volume-mode</p>

<p>Guides I've read indicate that the minibuffer is <em>always</em> in emacs state, so what's going on here and how can I fix it?</p>

<p>I'll add that the following does not fix the problem for me:</p>

<pre><code>(add-to-list 'evil-emacs-state-modes 'volume-mode)
</code></pre>

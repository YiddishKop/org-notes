<p>I'd like to have something that can apply some markup in LaTeX on the source code. For example some function to witch pass the source content to format it. Something like ":pass" header argument, for example, would be perfect but as far I can understand it works only for results, and not for the export of the code. Maybe I'm wrong?</p>

<p>And I'd like to read (or alter) some of the header arguments, for example to use ":noweb-ref" inside my formatting, if possible, or at least the chance to pass extra arguments to the formatter.</p>

<p>I know I can use dynamic blocks for my task, even if I don't really know how it is hard to replicate a source block with them, but I'd like to have something more direct and simpler to implement. But in case it was not possible, how can I replicate a source block with them? (I need exporting of code and tangling.)</p>

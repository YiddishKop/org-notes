This is something that’s bothered me for a very long time. My pinky is slow when
it comes to releasing the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, and frequently leads to typos. MOst typos
(hitting letters in the wrong order) are already covered by <a href="/ispell-and-abbrev-the-perfect-auto-correct.html">auto-correction</a>, but
there’s another common typo that it doesn’t fix. EVery now and then, I’ll start
a sentence with two uppercase letters.

After the billionth time that it happened to me, I finally took the time to
write up <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/13970/50">a question</a> on <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">Emacs.StackExchange</a>. The answers were fast, and so high
quality that I don’t even have improvements to suggest. Instead, I’ll just point
you straight to <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/13975/50">Dan's answer</a>, and show how I activate it.

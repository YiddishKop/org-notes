<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to join the Internet-wide trend of posting regular updates on
articles, blog posts, etc. that I have read recently and find interesting. I see
multiple benefits in such a practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>As a commitment mechanism:</strong> With the Internet watching, I will (hopefully)
feel more motivated to maintain good reading habits. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll have an
incentive to write about my insights on each piece (these posts would
otherwise be of no more value than any other news aggregation).</li>
  <li><strong>As a more effective method of sharing:</strong> Individual posts on social networks
often seem &ldquo;drowned out&rdquo; to me, quickly eclipsed by the slightly newer
articles displayed immediately above it. This form of more formal publication
should counter that effect.</li>
  <li><strong>As a log of my reading progress:</strong> I envision an archive of my reading
interests over the weeks / months / years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> could be very useful to my
future self.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, here begins the Sunday Links series!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  <li>Sean Trende from RealClearPolitics <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/14/is_the_value_of_campaign_spending_overstated_120667.html">claims that House campaign spending</a>
only has significant effects for challengers. This post is based on findings
from the late 80&rsquo;s / early 90&rsquo;s. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138764">Levitt (1994)</a> contradicts these ideas
and suggests that the marginal dollar of funding actually does little for both
the incumbent and the challenger, after controlling for candidate quality and
performing more than a simple cross-sectional analysis (as Trende has done).</li>
  <li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1213">Varshney et al. (2013)</a> describe a system for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity">computational creativity</a>. The system combines many disparate datasets on
cuisine and food ingredients (containing data concerning e.g. regional cooking
practices, observed links between chemicals and &ldquo;hedonic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">psychophysical</a>
effects,&rdquo; olfactory properties, etc. etc.) and automatically designs and
assesses &ldquo;creative&rdquo; novel meal recipes.</li>
  <li>F. A. Hayek&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html">&ldquo;The Use of Knowledge in Society&rdquo;</a> explains how a
free market can resolve the problem of insufficient knowledge on the part of
any given individual through prices. Hayek claims that a system of central
planning would require a single entity with total knowledge of the
circumstances of all of its constituents, and argues that a decentralized
system which regulates itself by prices is superior.</li>
  <li>David Luposchainsky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">provides examples</a> of <a href="https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/loeb-moeb.md">strange loops</a> in Haskell
with two simple functions, <code class="highlighter-rouge">loeb</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">moeb</code>.</li>

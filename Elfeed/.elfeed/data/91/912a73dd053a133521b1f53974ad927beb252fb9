While programming, I love to read documentation using <a href="https://github.com/areina/helm-dash">helm-dash</a>. I've created quite a <a href="https://github.com/kidd/HttpLuaModule.docset">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/kidd/PicoLisp.docset">docsets </a>for apps/languages that lacked them in the official repos.<br /><br />Currently I was using python, common lisp, Picolisp, and Redis, but I felt I was going too often to the <a href="http://franz.com/support/documentation/10.0/doc/index.htm">franz's Allegro Lisp documentation site</a>.  It's nice and loads fast, but it doesn't provide any useful search.<br /><br />So I created a<a href="https://github.com/kidd/AllegroLisp.docset"> dash docset for Franz's Allegro Lisp</a>.  As usual, it's in my <a href="https://github.com/kidd/">github</a>.<br /><br />And here's a little gif I recorded to see how does it look. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kidd/AllegroLisp.docset/master/out.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="253" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kidd/AllegroLisp.docset/master/out.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br />

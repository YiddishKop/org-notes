What started out as a cute idea I was playing around with, eventually turned to
be one of my favorite packages. Beacon won’t help you type faster, code
better, or cure cancer like some of the other packages. Its effect is mostly
cosmetic, but with practical benefits. Put simply, if you turn on this minor
mode, whenever the window scrolls up or down a light will blink on your cursor.
That’s it.

At first, I thought this would be purely cosmetic. But my super scientific
experience has been that there’s actually a practical benefit to it. The amount
of brain energy you save and the level of eye strain you avoid by having this
simple “eye-guide” is noticeable, specially during those late-night writing
marathons.

Just install from Gelpa with the usual <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>list-packages</code> and turn it on.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">beacon-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">beacon-push-mark</span> <span class="mi">35</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">beacon-color</span> <span class="s">"#666600"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

It has a lot of configuration options for you to specify situations where it
shouldn’t blink, as well as different details like duration, delay, size, and
color. Either have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon">Readme</a> or just issue <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>customize-group</code> to
see them all.

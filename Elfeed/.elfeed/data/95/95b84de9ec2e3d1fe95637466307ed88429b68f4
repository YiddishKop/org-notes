Whenever I try to select "stage all" or "unstage" all, I get asked to confirm the action with <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>. The problem is, when I hit <code>y</code>, nothing happens. Any idea what the issue could be?</p>

<p>(I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I <em>can</em> successfully abort the "stage all" operation with <code>n</code>. However, I can't do this for "unstage all".)</p>

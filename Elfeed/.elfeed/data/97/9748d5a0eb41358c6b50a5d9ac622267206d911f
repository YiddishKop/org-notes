off Vox&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Big Idea&rdquo; section with <a href="http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/9/14/12910180/noam-chomsky-tom-wolfe-linguist">a review of Tom Wolfe&rsquo;s evaluation of

  <li>C.A.R. Hoare reflects on software engineering experiences in <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2010/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf">&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s

    <blockquote>Our main failure was overambition. "The goals which we have
attempted have obviously proved to be far beyond our grasp." ...  What was

convincing ourselves and each other of the utterly absurd. Especially don’t
believe us when we promise to repeat an earlier success, only bigger and
better next time.</blockquote>

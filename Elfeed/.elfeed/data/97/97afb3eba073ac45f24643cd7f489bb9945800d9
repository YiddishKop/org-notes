<p> Dale Karp wanted to publish his activity log and notes so that others could see them and he could view them remotely. To do this, he set up an <a href="http://dale.io/blog/automated-org-publishing.html">automated publishing pipeline</a> using Emacs and Org mode. The idea is that he defines a “publishing project” in Org and invokes Emacs via <code>systemd</code> to run the export function on the project. </p>
<p> It’s a nice setup and one you may find handy if you want to regularly publish some Org files. He doesn’t have to do anything other than update his log files and they automatically get published to his GitHub Pages blog once a week. Head on over to his blog for the details. </p>

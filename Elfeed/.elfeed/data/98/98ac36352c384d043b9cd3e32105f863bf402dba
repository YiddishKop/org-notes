This tip comes from colleague of mine. Ben has a mailing group at work where he
sends weekly <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/bjm/emacs-tips.html">Emacs tips</a>. They’re always short and useful, but today’s tip was
quite the gem for me. <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/bjm/emacs-tips.html#sec-1-10">Emacs has a <code>comment-box</code> command</a>.

I’m sure half the readers know about this already, but I didn’t, so I thought
I’d share with the second half. He also offers an improved version of the
command, <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=374">originally by Snader</a>, which extends the box up to the <code>fill-column</code>.</p>

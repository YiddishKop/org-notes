<pre><code>'(font-lock-constant-face ((t (:foreground "#2aa198" :weight normal))))
 '(font-lock-keyword-face ((t (:foreground "#859900" :weight normal))))
 '(font-lock-variable-name-face ((t (:foreground "#839496")))))
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd also like imports to be highlighted with different color, stop highlighting "sys.exit()" as a constant etc, treat print as a builtin function, not as keyword etc. So I need to change how emacs parses python code. In vim you can do this by creating a custom syntax file and placing it in special folder, how to do the same for emacs?</p>

<pre><code>from abc import ABC
print('some')
map(int, ('1',))
int('1')


@cached
def name(a, abc='abc'):
    pass

name(1, abc='bca')
</code></pre>

<p>The right one is how I want syntax highlighting to look and the left one is emacs.</p>

<p>
After adding <a href="/asynchronous-package-upgrades-with-paradox.html">asynchronous operations</a> to <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/">Paradox</a>, I saw the need to provide some
visual feedback to the user. In the simplest sense, this could be a fixed
message on the mode-line, such as <i>“Upgrading&#x2026;”</i> or <i>“Working”</i>, but this is
not enough. I needed movement. Movement implies something is ongoing. It catches
your eye and gives you that subconscious reassurance that progress is being
made. A tiny spinning wheel, hourglass, or rainbow is enough to sooth all your
doubts, unerringly restoring your confidence on the software and those who made
it.
</p>

<p>
Today, I introduce <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/spinner.el">spinner.el</a>, Emacs’ version of the spinning hourglass.
</p>

<p>
The spinner is added to the mode-line of a specific buffer, and stays there
until stopped by the program. In the case of Paradox, for instance, you get a
spinner on the <code>*Packages*</code> buffer to indicate background operations are
ongoing, and it is immediately removed once they are finished.
</p>

<p>
Using the package is as simple as calling <code>(spinner-start 'vertical-rising)</code>
(eventually followed by <code>spinner-stop</code>). There are currently 17 different
spinners available (see above), and you can also specify the animation speed or
even add your own animations.
</p>

<p>
Spinner.el is available to all Emacs versions running <code>package.el</code>, so hopefully
other packages will make use of it as well.

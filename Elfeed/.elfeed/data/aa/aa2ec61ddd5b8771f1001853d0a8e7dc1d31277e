sometimes. I assume it will remember all previous appeared window layout, but
there are some layout missing once a while. Besides, if I overshot with winner undo, I can't get back without repeat the long undoing process. So any help on:</p>

<pre><code>1. let winner mode remember all window layout?

2. make winner-redo jut redo one undo, and maybe adding a function
winner-startover to switch back to the layout before undoing.

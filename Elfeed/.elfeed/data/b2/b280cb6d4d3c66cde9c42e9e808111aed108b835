<p>If I want to move to the 33rd <em>line</em> in a file, I execute <code>M-x goto-line &lt;RET&gt; 33</code>, but there does not seem to be an equivalent <code>goto-paragraph</code> function.</p>

<p>I could write a function to do this for me (i.e. go to beginning of file, then execute <code>forward-paragraph</code> X number of times), but I am wondering if there is a built-in function for this already.</p>

<p>I'd like to have <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> act as <code>C-j</code> does here, but not necessarily everywhere else. I checked, and <code>C-j</code> is bound to <code>#'helm-maybe-exit-minibuffer</code>, whereas <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> is bound to <code>#'helm-execute-persistent-action</code>. Binding <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> to <code>#'helm-maybe-exit-minibuffer</code> works for this case, but breaks other cases: for example, the helm autocomplete in <code>describe-function</code>.</p>

<p>So, when using Helm to find a file, how can I make pressing <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> open that directory in Helm?</p>

<p>Some of my more ambitious machine-learning colleagues often have a tendency to
get misty-eyed and talk about language as the &ldquo;next frontier&rdquo; of artificial
intelligence. I can completely agree at a high level: building practical
language-enabled agents which can use real language with real people will be a
huge breakthrough for our field.</p>

<p>But too frequently people seem to see language as a mere box to be checked
along the way to general artificial intelligence. As soon as we break through
some perplexity floor on our language models, apparently, we&rsquo;ll have dialogue
agents that can communicate just like we do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been exposed to this exhausting view often enough<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> that I&rsquo;ve decided to
start working to actively counter it.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-solve-language">What does it mean to &ldquo;solve language?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what people are trying to say when they talk about
&ldquo;solving language.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s as vague and underspecified as the quest to &ldquo;solve
AI&rdquo; as a whole. We already have <a href="https://www.rebellionresearch.com/">systems that build investment strategies by
reading the news</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">intelligent personal assistants</a>, and <a href="https://x2.ai/">automated
psychologists which aid the clinically depressed</a>. Are we done?</p>

<p>It depends on your measure of done-ness, I suppose. I&rsquo;m partial to a
utilitarian stopping criterion here. That is, we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;solved language&rdquo; &mdash; we&rsquo;ve
built an agent which &ldquo;understands language&rdquo; &mdash; when the agent can embed itself
into any <strong>real-world</strong> environment and interact with us humans via language to
make us more productive.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>On that measure we&rsquo;ve actually made some good progress, as shown by the linked
examples above. But there&rsquo;s plenty of room for improvement which will likely
amount to decades of collaborative work.</p>

<p>If you can show me how your favorite NLP/NLU task connects directly to this
measure of progress, then that&rsquo;s great. I unfortunately don&rsquo;t think this is the
case for much current work, including several of the tasks popular in deep
learning for NLP.</p>

<p><small>(See the <a href="#addenda">addenda</a> to the post for some juicy follow-up to
        the claims in this section.)</small></p>

<h2 id="situated-language-use">Situated language use</h2>

<p>If I believe in the definition of &ldquo;solving language&rdquo; given above, I am led to
focus on tasks of <strong>situated language use</strong>: cases where agents are
influencing or being influenced by other actors in grounded scenarios through
language.</p>

<p>This setting seems extremely fertile for new language problems that aren&rsquo;t
currently seriously considered as major tasks of understanding. I&rsquo;ll end this
post with a simple thought experiment demonstrating how far behind we are on
real situated tasks &mdash; or rather, how much exciting work there still is to be
done!</p>

<h2 id="generalization-in-reference-games">Generalization in reference games</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple example of situated learning that should reveal the great
complexity of language we have yet really to start solving.</p>

<p>Consider a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-game_(philosophy)">Wittgensteinian reference game</a> with two agents, <em>Alexa</em> and
<em>Bill</em>. Alexa is using words that Bill doesn&rsquo;t know to pick out referents in
their environment. It&rsquo;s a cooperative game: Alexa tries to use words that will
make Bill most successful, Bill knows that Alexa is cooperating, Alexa knows
that Bill knows that she is cooperating, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>

<p>Alexa selects some object in the environment and speaks a word to Bill, say,
<em>BLOOP</em>. Here&rsquo;s what Bill has observed in this first round of the game:</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<h4>Possible referents:</h4>
<div style="margin-top:10px">
<div style="width:50%;float:left;"><img src="http://www.foldl.me/uploads/2016/reference-game/glass.png" style="border:none" /></div>
<div style="width:50%;float:left;"><img src="http://www.foldl.me/uploads/2016/reference-game/pen.png" style="border:none;" /></div>
</div>
<br style="clear:left" />
<h4>Alexa said: <em>BLOOP</em></h4>
</div>

<p>Now Bill has to select the object he thinks Alexa was referring to. The
dialogue is a &ldquo;success&rdquo; if Alexa and Bill pick the same object.</p>

<p>Suppose Bill has to predict some distribution over the objects given Alexa&rsquo;s
utterance \(\pi(o \mid u)\). Since Bill doesn&rsquo;t know any of Alexa&rsquo;s words
in the first round, we would expect his distribution then to be roughly
uniform:<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<figure class="image"><img class="noborder" src="http://www.foldl.me//uploads/2016/reference-game/round1-policy.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say he randomly chooses the cup, and the two are informed that they have
succeeded. That means Alexa used <em>BLOOP</em> to refer to the cup. Both internalize
that information and proceed to the next round.</p>

<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>

<p>Now suppose we begin round 2 with different objects. Alexa, still trying to
maximize the chance that Bill understands what she is referring to, makes
<strong>the same utterance</strong>: <em>BLOOP</em>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<h4>Possible referents:</h4>
<div style="margin-top:10px">
<div style="width:50%;float:left;"><img src="http://www.foldl.me/uploads/2016/reference-game/mug.png" style="border:none" /></div>
<div style="width:50%;float:left;"><img src="http://www.foldl.me/uploads/2016/reference-game/rabbit.png" style="border:none;" /></div>
</div>
<br style="clear:left" />
<h4>Alexa said: <em>BLOOP</em></h4>
</div>

<p>I would argue that, despite the fact that <strong>both objects are novel</strong> (at least
at a perceptual level), Bill&rsquo;s probabilities would look something like this:</p>

<figure class="image"><img class="noborder" src="http://www.foldl.me//uploads/2016/reference-game/round2-policy.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>What happened? Bill learned something about Alexa&rsquo;s language in round 1: that
her word <em>BLOOP</em> can refer to a glass. In round 2, he was forced to
<strong>generalize</strong> that information and use it to pick the most cup-like object
among the referents.</p>

<h3 id="what-just-happened">What just happened?</h3>

<p>How do we model this? There&rsquo;s a lot going on. Here are the three most important
properties I can recognize.</p>

<ol>
  <li>As is often the case in reference game examples, Bill had to reason
<strong>pragmatically</strong> in round 2 in order to understand what Alexa might mean.</li>
  <li>This pragmatic reasoning relied on a <strong>model of the world</strong>. Bill had to
reason that the mug was similar to the cup, not because they look alike but
because they are both used for drinking.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Bill made his inference using <strong>a single previous example</strong>. This inductive
inference relied mostly on his model of the world, as opposed to an enormous
dataset of in-domain examples.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are three basic properties of Bill the language agent. These are three
properties that we haven&rsquo;t come anywhere close to solving in a general way.</p>

<p>(These goals have been recognized in the past, of course; there&rsquo;s been some
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00562">good</a> <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/papers/potts-levy-2015-bls.pdf">recent</a> <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4929-learning-and-using-language-via-recursive-pragmatic-reasoning-about-other-agents">work</a> on the specific problems above. But I think
 these objectives should get much more focus under the utilitarian motivation
 underlying this post.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That rather long example was my first stab at picking out <strong>situated</strong> learning
problems, where language is a mean rather than an end in itself. It&rsquo;s just one
sample from what I see as a large space of underexplored problems. Any language
researcher worth her salt could engineer a quick solution to this particular
scenario. The real challenge is to tackle the whole problem class with an
integrated solution. Why don&rsquo;t we start working on <em>that?</em></p>

<p>Keep posted for updates in this space &mdash; I&rsquo;m working hard every day
on projects related to this goal at <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a>. If you&rsquo;re interested in

<p>Many of my trusted colleagues who reviewed this post made interesting and
relevant points which are worth mentioning. I&rsquo;ve included them in a separate
section in order to prevent the main post from getting too long and full of
hedging clauses.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I claimed in this post that work in natural language understanding often
seems too disconnected from the real downstream utilitarian goal&mdash;in the
case of our field, to actually <strong>use language</strong> in order to cooperate with
human beings. <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/">Roger</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/">Sam</a> pointed out that many people in
the field do feel this to be true at a broader scale &mdash; that is, there are
several such related divergences (e.g. the divergence between modern NLP and
its computational linguistics roots) that ought to be unified.</li>
  <li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Chris</a> pointed out that there are other uses of language which could
be used to likewise argue for different lines of research. For example,
language also functions as an information storage mechanism, and my
situated approach doesn&rsquo;t capture this. We can actually use this
information-storage view to motivate many of the tasks central to NLP or,
more specifically, information extraction.</li>

      <p>Interestingly, if both Alexa and Bill have English as a native language, I would guess that phonaesthetic effects would lead Bill to prefer the round object over the long, pointy one.

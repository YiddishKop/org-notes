I’ve said before that <a href="/clj-refactor-unleash-your-clojure-wizard.html">clj-refactor is a magical package</a>, and you wouldn’t catch
me bad-mouthing it in a million release cycles, but it’s impossible to please
everybody. 
</p>

<p>
One consistent annoyance I have with it, is that I always have to type <kbd>Tab</kbd>
twice after invoking <code>cljr-add-require-to-ns</code>. That’s because I only ever use
requires of the form <code>[x.y :as y]</code>, so I always have to skip the first two
“modes” offered by the snippet.
</p>

<p>
As I was teaching a friend about this command last week, he immediately asked me
if you couldn’t just write some Elisp to do that for you. Of course, the answer
is yes. And that’s exactly what I did &#x2014; once I was done feeling embarrassed
that I hadn’t thought of that before.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">advice-add</span> <span class="ss">'cljr-add-require-to-ns</span> <span class="ss">:after</span>
            <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">&amp;rest</span> <span class="nv">_</span><span class="p">)</span>
              <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">yas-next-field</span><span class="p">)</span>
              <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">yas-next-field</span><span class="p">)))</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
Note that this uses the new advice interface, which relies on Emacs 24.5. While
this API in its entirety can be quite intimidating, you don’t need to learn it
all in one go. You can go a long way (and make your life a lot easier) by just
writing yourself a few <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> advices.
</p>

<p>
Just remember to be responsible. Advices let you run code in places where
packages don’t expect code to be run. So don’t be surprised if something else
breaks.</p>

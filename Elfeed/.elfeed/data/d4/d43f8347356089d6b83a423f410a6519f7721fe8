Two months ago, I listed <a href="/big-things-to-expect-from-emacs-25.html">a few big things</a> I was looking forward to for Emacs 25.
I knew I was being unrealistically optimistic to mention concurrency in Elisp,
but there was a point behind it. It bothered me a lot that I had to get up and
go for a coffee whenever I upgraded more than a few packages, and asynchronous
upgrades were the only way I saw of fixing that. This Christmas, as promised and
well ahead of schedule, I've implemented asynchronous execution into <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/#paradox">Paradox</a>,
thanks to the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async">async</a> library.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that whenever you hit <kbd>x</kbd> on Paradox's Package Menu, be it an
upgrade, installation, or deletion, if you've installed the <code>async</code> library,
you'll have the option to perform the operation in the background. Then you can
get back to work and forget about it. Paradox will message you once it's done,
and that's it.
</p>

<p>
You can customize whether or not you want this feature with the
<code>paradox-execute-asynchronously</code> variable (the default is to ask you each time).
It is still considered a beta feature, so you won't find it on Melpa-stable yet.
You can get it on Melpa or wait a couple of weeks for it to be marked stable.
</p>

<p>
As a bonus, there's also a new command <code>paradox-upgrade-packages</code>, inspired by
<a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/4052/50">this Emacs.SE question</a>, which upgrades everything without the usual manual
labor.

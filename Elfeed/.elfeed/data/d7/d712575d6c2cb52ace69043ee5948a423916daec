The site goes well and the curtains are raised. The
<a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">Emacs.StackExchange</a> beta has left the privacy of its dressing room and
ventures onto the public stage. Even if you have nothing in your mind to
ask, go pay it a visit and have a browse through the questions. The
quality of content is impressive, and you’re sure to learn something
of interest.
</p>

<p>
I’ve already brought here several lessons I would never have learnt if
not for the beta. <a href="/auto-focus-a-relevant-file-in-dired-buffers.html">Smart Dired</a>, <a href="/longlines-mode-in-latex.html">Longlines mode</a>, and <a href="/permanent-auto-indentation.html">Aggressive
Auto-indentation</a> are now essential parts of my init file. Of course,
I’ll keep bringing more, they come up faster than I can write about them.
</p>

<p>
Not to mention, the community is friendly and intelligent. Not that
it’s any surprise in the Emacs ecosystem.

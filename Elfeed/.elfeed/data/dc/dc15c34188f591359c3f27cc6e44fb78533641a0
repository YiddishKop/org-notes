<pre><code>(latex-preview-pane-enable)
</code></pre>

<p>However, every time I open a <code>.tex</code> file, I have to run <code>M-x latex-preview-pane-mode</code> since the latex preview pane is not there by default.</p>

<p>I have done this before on another distro, and it worked. Anyone know why this might not be working?</p>

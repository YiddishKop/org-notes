<p>
One of the questions we get most often about CIDER is “can I configure X on a
per-project basis?”. Occasionally, you find someone suggesting (or even
implementing) some sophisticated configurable variable trying to account for
multiple simultaneous use-cases. Fortunately that’s one effort we don’t need to
make. Emacs already has that built-in in the form of directory-local variables
(dir-local for short).
</p>

<p>
As the name implies, dir-local variable values (can) apply to all files inside a
given directory (also applying recursively to its sub-directories), though you
can also restrict them by major-mode or by subdirectory. To configure it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Invoke <kbd>M-x</kbd> <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/add-dir-local-variable"><code>add-dir-local-variable</code></a>.</li>
<li>This will prompt you for a major-mode, then a variable name, and finally a
variable value.</li>
<li>Finally, it will drop you in a (newly-created) file called <code>.dir-locals.el</code>
   in the current directory. Just save this file and you’re done!</li>
</ol>

<p>
By doing this, you have configured the given variable to always have the
provided value anywhere inside the <b>current directory</b>, so make sure you’re at
the root of your project when you call the command. If you use <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>,
there’s the <code>projectile-edit-dir-locals</code> command for doing just that.
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you type <code>nil</code> for the major-mode, it applies to all major-modes.</li>
<li>There is (of course) tab-completion in the variable-name prompt.</li>
<li>If you answer <code>eval</code> for the variable name, it will prompt you for a lisp
expression, instead of a value. This expression will be saved and will be
evaluated every time a file is visited.</li>
<li>After doing this, call <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/revert-buffer"><code>revert-buffer</code></a> on any previously-open files to
apply the new value.</li>
</ul>

It’s worth mentioning that Joel McCracken posted <a href="http://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/project-local-variables-in-projectile-with-dirlocals/">a similar quick guide</a> a few
years ago. Some of the information is the same, but some is complementary, so
you might want to have a look.</p>

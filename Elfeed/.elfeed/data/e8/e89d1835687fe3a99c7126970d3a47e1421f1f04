This happens every time, which suggests that there is no caching to speed things up for the next time.</p>

<p>Is there a way to avoid the pause after every time I type <code>std::</code>?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Using the emacs profiler, I have now discovered that the pretty much all of the time is being spent in the functions <code>semantic-analyze-possible-completions</code> and <code>semantic-analyze-current-context</code>. This suggests that the real problem probably lies with semantic.  I have also learned that including anything from the Boost libraries causes a significant increase in the amount of time required for semantic to return possible completions.</p>

<p>(In case it makes a difference, I am using Emacs 24.5 on Linux)</p>

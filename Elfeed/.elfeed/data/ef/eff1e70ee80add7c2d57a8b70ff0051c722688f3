<p>Engineers and scientists all over the world are using Python and <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW</a> to solve hard problems in manufacturing and test automation, by taking advantage of the vast ecosystem of Python software.  But going from an engineer&#8217;s proof-of-concept to a stable, production-ready version of Python, smoothly integrated with LabVIEW, has long been elusive.</p>
<p><a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6345172033898452482"><strong>Join us for a live webinar and demo</strong></a>, as we take a LabVIEW data acquisition app and extend it with Python&#8217;s machine learning capabilities, to automatically detect and classify equipment vibration.  Using a modern Python platform and the <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/python-for-labview/">Python Integration Toolkit for LabVIEW</a>, we&#8217;ll show how easy and fast it is to install heavy-hitting Python analysis libraries, take advantage of them from live LabVIEW code, and finally deploy the entire solution, Python included, using LabVIEW Application Builder.</p>

<li><strong>Download a free 30 day trial of the <a href="http://www.ni.com/gate/gb/GB_EVALTLKTPYTHONLVENTH/US">Python Integration Toolkit for LabVIEW</a></strong> from the NI LabVIEW Tools Network</li>
</ul>
<p>Quickly and efficiently access scientific and engineering tools for signal processing, machine learning, image and array processing, web and cloud connectivity, and much more. With only minimal coding on the Python side, this extraordinarily simple interface provides access to all of Python’s capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the Python Integration Toolkit for LabVIEW?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/python-for-labview/">Python Integration Toolkit for LabVIEW</a> provides a seamless bridge between Python and LabVIEW. With fast two-way communication between environments, your LabVIEW project can benefit from thousands of mature, well-tested software packages in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>Run Python and LabVIEW side by side, and exchange data live. Call Python functions directly from LabVIEW, and pass arrays and other numerical data natively. Automatic type conversion virtually eliminates the “boilerplate” code usually needed to communicate with non-LabVIEW components.</p>
<p>Develop and test your code quickly with <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Enthought Canopy</a>, a complete integrated development environment and supported Python distribution included with the Toolkit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is LabVIEW?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://ni.com/labview">LabVIEW</a> is a software platform made by <a href="http://www.ni.com">National Instruments</a>, used widely in industries such as semiconductors, telecommunications, aerospace, manufacturing, electronics, and automotive for test and measurement applications. In August 2016, Enthought released the <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/python-for-labview/">Python Integration Toolkit for LabVIEW</a>, which is a “bridge” between the LabVIEW and Python environments.</p>

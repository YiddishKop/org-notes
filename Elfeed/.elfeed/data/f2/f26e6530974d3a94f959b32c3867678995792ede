Although thereâ€™s a surprising number of packages offering alternative minibuffer
selection systems, the default minibuffer completion in Emacs is nothing to be
scoffed at. Hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd> in the minibuffer gives you a slightly beefed up
version of the bash completion, and after all these years that is still my
preferred method for completing file-names (though I do have some <a href="/visit-directory-inside-a-set-of-directories.html">custom-written
alternatives</a>).

Still, there are two small changes you can make that significantly improve the
convenience of this feature. The simplest one is to make it case-insensitive.
The second, and more fine-tuned, is to exclude extensions which you never really
want. These are usually auto-generated files whose names are similar to files
you care about. My list is useful for elisp and LaTeX, so you may need to figure
out yours.

I tried the following codes mentioned on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/emacs-helm/US8FWnfRu5o" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, but didn't work for me.</p>

<pre><code>(add-hook 'helm-before-initialize-hook #'(lambda () (helm-attrset 'follow 1 helm-source-mark-ring)))
</code></pre>

<p>Result: It shows <code>[Display not ready]</code> in echo area when I change the helm candidate (by <code>C-n</code>).</p>

<p>Any help appreciated!</p>

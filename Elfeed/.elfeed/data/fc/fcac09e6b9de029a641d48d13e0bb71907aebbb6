<p>
When I first started learning Clojure, I was charmed by how well integrated
CIDER was with Emacs. In many ways, it felt just like writing Emacs-lisp.
Nowadays, that feeling has gone slightly past the goal mark, and there are
actually features I miss when I’m writing elisp. <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el#readme">Clj-refactor</a> is one of them.
</p>

<p>
This package is a Swiss knife of refactoring utilities for Clojure. From simple
operations like turning a form into a <code>-&gt;</code> thread, to the more complex
situations like renaming entire namespaces, it’s hard to find something
clj-refactor can’t do.
</p>

<p>
I won’t list all of them here, they already have a nice <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki">wiki page</a> for that. The
point here is to expose a few features (the ones I find most useful) and
hopefully that’ll get you started on the road to enlightenment. To see some of
the features in play (at a pretty quick pace), you can check out Magnar’s <a href="http://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/">Parens
of the dead</a> videos. I also plan on doing a proper and thorough video review of
this package in the future.
</p>

<p>
First, and most importantly, are the threading commands. These allow you to
instantly turn something like <code>(filter odd? (map inc (range n)))</code> into
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">inc</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">filter</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">odd?</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
or back again. Clj-refactor default keybinds are pretty well thought out, but I
use these commands so frequently that I felt the need to shorten them to just 2
or 3 keys.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">with-eval-after-load</span> <span class="ss">'clj-refactor</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">cljr-thread-all-but-last</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">clj-refactor-map</span> <span class="s">"\C-ctf"</span> <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">cljr-thread-first-all</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">clj-refactor-map</span> <span class="s">"\C-ctl"</span> <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">cljr-thread-last-all</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">clj-refactor-map</span> <span class="s">"\C-cu"</span> <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">cljr-unwind</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">clj-refactor-map</span> <span class="s">"\C-cU"</span> <span class="nf">#'</span><span class="nv">cljr-unwind-all</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
Next is another feature that comes up a lot, but this one doesn’t even take up a
keybind. When you type <code>/</code>, clj-refactor will look at the alias you’ve just
written, and try to add a require for it in the <code>ns</code> form. The current snapshot
release is very smart about it, and actually learns what alias you use for each
namespace by looking at other files in the same project. You can also define
your preferences with the <code>cljr-magic-require-namespaces</code> variable.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">with-eval-after-load</span> <span class="ss">'clj-refactor</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">'cljr-magic-require-namespaces</span>
               <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"s"</span>  <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">"clojure.string"</span><span class="p">)))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
Another command you should definitely memorize is <code>cljr-create-fn-from-example</code>.<br  />
<a href="/images/create-fn-from-example.gif"><img src="/images/create-fn-from-example.gif" alt="create-fn-from-example.gif" /></a><br  />
Instead of specifying a custom key for this one, we’ll just let the package
define all other keys for us.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">with-eval-after-load</span> <span class="ss">'clj-refactor</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix</span> <span class="s">"\C-cr"</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
The nice thing about the default keys is that they’re mnemonic, and you might
remember I have an <a href="/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html">entire series</a> on this topic. The point being: it’s very easy
to remember that <code>cljr-create-fn-from-example</code> is bound to <kbd>C-c r f e</kbd> when you
can actually sing <i>“clojure refactor from example”</i> as you’re typing.
</p>

<p>
A few others I use a lot (and the keys they’re bound to) are <code>introduce-let</code> (<kbd>i
l</kbd>), <code>move-to-let</code> (<kbd>m l</kbd>), and <code>promote-function</code> (<kbd>p f</kbd>).
</p>

<p>
Lastly, some miscellaneous configurations that simply reflect my personal
preferences, but which you should be aware of nonetheless.

<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">cljr-favor-prefix-notation</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">cljr-favor-private-functions</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>

      <span class="s">"[clojure.test :refer :all]"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

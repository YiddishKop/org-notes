   google guy who invented MapReduce, here is some jokes about him:
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Compilers don’t warn Jeff Dean. Jeff Dean warns compilers.

   Jeff Dean builds his code before committing it, but only to
   check for compiler and linker bugs.

   Jeff Dean writes directly in binary. He then writes the
   source code as a documentation for other developers.

   Jeff Dean once shifted a bit so hard, it ended up on another
   computer.

   When Jeff Dean has an ergonomic evaluation, it is for the
   protection of his keyboard.

   gcc -O4 emails your code to Jeff Dean for a rewrite.

   When he heard that Jeff Dean's autobiography would be
   exclusive to the platform, Richard Stallman bought a
   Kindle.

   Jeff Dean puts his pants on one leg at a time, but if he had
   more legs, you’d realize the algorithm is actually only
   O(logn)

    Memory access/instructions are qualitatively different from disk access

    Seeks are qualitatively different from sequential reads on disk

    Cache, disk fetches, etc work best when you stream through data sequentially

    Best case for data processing: stream through the data once in sequential order,
    as it’s found on disk.

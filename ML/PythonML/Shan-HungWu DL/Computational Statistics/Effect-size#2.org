#+TITLE: Effect size

* Effect size #2, difference in proportions
*** background
Of the children who avoided peanut, ~17%~ developed peanut allergy by the age 5
years; Remarkably, only ~3%~ of the children who were randomized to eating the
peanut snack developed allergy by age 5.

Therefore, in high-risk infants, sustained consumption of peanut beginning in
the first 11 months of life was highly effective in preventing the development
of peanut allergy.

Using ONLY ONE number to tell me, what's the effect was.

cohen's d = (mean1 - mean2)/s
s = pooled std

experiment group: %3 or 17%
control group: %17 or 3%

you can say, sustained consumption of peanut will give 14% of reduction on
peanut allergy.

Boundary between experiment group and control group is not clear, so both
direction is OK.

BUUUT, percetage difference is not a clear concept to describe the difference.

%17 to %3, 14/17 = %83, consumption of peanut decrease allergy rate by 83
percent.

%3 to %17, 14/3 = %467, avoiding of peanut increase allergy rate by 467 percent.

*** From probability to Odds Ratio(OR)
(odds and probability can change to each other)

p1 = 0.03
p2 = 0.17

odds = p / ( 1- p )

o1 = 0.0309
o2 = 0.2048

OR = o1/o2 = 0.151

eating peanuts decreases allergy rates (OR=0.15)

eating peanuts decreases allergy rates (OR=6.6)

*** From Odds Ratio(OR) to Log Odds Ratio(LOR)
(advantage is ~symmetric~)

eating peanuts decreases allergy rates (LOR= ~-0.82~)

eating peanuts decreases allergy rates (LOR= ~0.82~)

professor says that, if I can make everyone in th world use LOR, I will do it.

*** The advantages of LOR

   If you dive into information theory, LOR is a measure of information content
   if you tell me what the treatment was, that'll tell me how to do a Bayesian
   update about how much I should believe you get a peanut allergy and then add
   up if you apply several different treatments that have long odds ratios of
   one ,two and three. The total of all of those treatments is six at least if I
   assume that they're independent.

*** Different express ways:

| Treatment          | Diff in rate | percent chage | Odds ratio | Log Odds ratio |
|--------------------+--------------+---------------+------------+----------------|
| administer peanuts | -14 points   |          -83% |       0.15 |          -0.82 |
| withhold peanuts   | +14 points   |         +467% |        6.6 |          +0.82 |

Tradoff from these ways:
1. Choose a measure of effect size that is meaningful in context.
2. The estimated effect size is the most important result. Everything else is auxiliary.
3. Standardized measures are comparable across studies(sometimes violate rule#1).

Log Odds Rate is the Bayes factor; Bayes factor is a measure of the information content.

.
.  0.5% of women in population will have breast cancer;
.
.             0.005
.    Odds = --------- = 0.005
.             0.995
.
.  In statistics, pretest odds is almost the same with the prtest probability.

.  Bayes Theorem:
.  Post-test odds = Pre-test odds * LR+
.                 = 0.005 * 8.9
.                 = 0.045
.     probability = Odds/(1+Odds)
.                 = 0.045/(1+0.045)
.                 = 4.3%
.
.  means that if you have a +ve result of cancer test, you ONLY have a probability of 4.3% to really get a cancer.
.
.  If your doctor find the shadow in your mammograms(乳房照), then the pre-test probability is 30% not 0.5%
.
.             0.3
.    Odds = ------- = 0.43
.             0.7
.
.  Bayes Theorem:
.  Post-test odds = Pre-test odds * LR+
.                 = 0.43 * 8.9
.                 = 3.8
.     probability = Odds/(1+Odds)
.                 = 3.8/(1+3.8)
.                 = 79%
.
.  means that if you have a +ve result of cancer test, you ALMOST have a probability of 79% to really get a cancer.
.
.  This is why mammograms is an important tool.

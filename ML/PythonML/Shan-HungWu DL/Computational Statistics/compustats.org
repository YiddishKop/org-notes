* Statistical inference

using data from a sample to infer information about a population.

Example: drug testing.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
50 parients got a new pain-killer; 50 similar patients got an older drug.
Mean self-reported pain scores were 4.1 for new drug and 4.5 for old drug.
#+END_QUOTE

Statistical inference address:
1. how can we *estimate* the difference in effect of the drugs
2. how can we quantify the *precision* of that estimate
3. Is it possible that the apparent difference is *due to chance*

Effect size:
usually a single number, ideally comparable across studies.

Confidence interval and/or standard error:
quantifies the *precision* of the estimate.

p-value:
indicates *whether* the apparent effect might be *due to chance*.

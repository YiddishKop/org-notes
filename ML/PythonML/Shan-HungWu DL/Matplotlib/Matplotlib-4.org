#+TITLE: Matplotlib

* part-III, How to speak "MPL"
In the previous parts, you learned how Matplotlib organizes plot-making by
figures and axes. We broke down the components of a basic figure and learned how
to create them. You also learned how to add one or more axes to a figure, and
how to tie them together. You even learned how to change some of the basic
appearances of the axes. Finally, we went over some of the many plotting methods
that Matplotlib has to draw on those axes. With all that knowledge, you should
be off making great and wonderful figures.

Why are you still here?

"We don't know how to control our plots and figures!" says some random voice in
the back of the room.

Of course! While the previous sections may have taught you some of the structure
and syntax of Matplotlib, it did not describe much of the substance and
vocabulary of the library. This section will go over many of the properties that
are used throughout the library. Note that while many of the examples in this
section may show one way of setting a particular property, that property may be
applicible elsewhere in completely different context. This is the "language" of
Matplotlib.

** Colors
This is, perhaps, the *most important* piece of vocabulary in Matplotlib. Given
that Matplotlib is a plotting library, colors are associated with everything
that is plotted in your figures. Matplotlib supports a very robust language for
specifying colors that should be familiar to a wide variety of users.

*** Colornames
    *First, colors can be given as strings*. For very basic colors, you can even get
    away with just a single letter:

    | b | blue    |
    | g | green   |
    | r | red     |
    | c | cyan    |
    | m | magenta |
    | y | yellow  |
    | k | black   |
    | w | white   |

    Other colornames that are allowed are the HTML/CSS colornames such as
    "burlywood" and "chartreuse". See the full list of the 147 colornames. For the
    British speaking and poor spellers among us (I am not implying that British
    speakers are poor spellers!), we allow "grey" where-ever "gray" appears in that
    list of colornames. All of these colornames are case-insensitive.

*** Hex values
    *Colors can also be specified by supplying a HTML/CSS hex string*, such as
    '#0000FF' for blue. Support for an optional alpha channel was added for v2.0.

*** 256 Shades of Gray
    A gray level can be given instead of a color by passing a string representation
    of a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. *'0.0' is black*, while *'1.0' is white*.
    *'0.75' would be a light shade of gray*.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  t = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.2)
  # declare the colors explicitly.
  plt.plot(t, t, 'r', t, t**2, 'lightgray', t, t**3, '0.0')
  plt.show()
#+END_SRC
*** RGB[A] tuples
    You may come upon instances where the previous ways of specifying colors do
    not work. This can sometimes happen in some of the deeper, stranger levels
    of the library. When all else fails, the universal language of colors for
    matplotlib is the ~RGB[A] tuple~. This is the "*Red*", "*Green*", "*Blue*",
    and sometimes "*Alpha*" tuple of floats in the range of [0, 1]. One means
    full saturation of that channel, so a red RGBA tuple would be ~(1.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 1.0)~, whereas a *partly* *transparent* green RGBA tuple would be
    ~(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75)~. The documentation will usually specify whether it
    accepts RGB or RGBA tuples. Sometimes, a list of tuples would be required
    for multiple colors, and you can even supply a *Nx3* or *Nx4* numpy array in
    such cases.

    In functions such as ~plot()~ and ~scatter()~, while it may appear that they
    can take a color specification, what they really need is a "*format
    specification*", which includes color as part of the format. Unfortunately,
    such specifications are string only and ~so RGB[A] tuples are not supported~
    ~for such arguments~ (but you can still pass an RGB[A] tuple for a "color"
    argument).

    Oftentimes there is a separate argument for "alpha" where-ever you can specify a
    color. The value for "alpha" will usually take precedence over the alpha value
    in the RGBA tuple. There is no easy way around this inconsistency.

*** Cycle references
    you give a cycle of color, you don't care what is the 1st 2nd 3rd ... color is.
    what you want is color your current component with the 3rd color, the ONLY job
    you need to do is giving color ~C3~.

    With the advent of fancier color cycles coming from the many available styles,
    users *needed a way to reference those colors in the style without explicitly*
    *knowing what they are*. So, in v2.0, the ability to reference the first 10
    iterations of the color cycle was added. Whereever one could specify a color,
    you can supply a 2 character string of '*C#*'. So, '*C0*' would be the first color,
    'C1' would be the second, and so on and so forth up to 'C9'.

** Markers

   | marker | description   | marker | description     | marker | description    | marker | description |

   | "."    | point         | "+"    | plus            | ","    | pixel          | "x"    | cross       |

** Plot attributes
   With just about any plot you can make, there are *many attributes* that can be
   modified to make the lines and markers suit your needs. Note that for many
   plotting functions, Matplotlib will *cycle the colors for each dataset* you
   plot. However, you are free to explicitly state which colors you want used
   for which plots. For ~plt.plot()~, *you can mix the specification for the
   colors, linestyles, and markers in a single string*.

** Colormaps
   Another very important property of many figures is the *colormap*. The job of a
   colormap is to *relate a scalar value to a color*. In addition to the regular
   portion of the colormap, an "over", "under" and "bad" color can be optionally
   defined as well. NaNs will trigger the "bad" part of the colormap.

   As we all know, we create figures in order to *convey information visually* to our
   readers. There is much care and consideration that have gone into the design of
   these colormaps. Your choice in which colormap to use depends on what you are
   displaying. In mpl, the "~jet~" colormap has historically *been used by default*,
   but it will often not be the colormap you would want to use. Much discussion has
   taken place on the mailing lists with regards to what colormap should be
   default. The ~v2.0~ release of Matplotlib adopted *a new default colormap*,
   '~viridis~', along with some other stylistic changes to the defaults.

   Here is the full gallery of all the pre-defined colormaps, organized by the
   types of data they are usually used for.

** Mathtext
   Oftentimes, you just simply need that *superscript* or some other ~math text~
   in your labels. Matplotlib provides a very easy way to do this for those
   ~familiar with LaTeX~. Any text that is ~surrounded by dollar signs~ will be
   treated as "*mathtext*". Do note that because backslashes are prevelent in
   LaTeX, it is often a good idea to prepend an ~r~ to your string literal so that
   Python will not treat the backslashes as escape characters.

   'r'+string in python means this 'string' is a raw String. every symbol inside is
   itself, instead of its special mean.

** Hatches
   背景纹路
   A Patch object can have a hatching defined for it.

   | symbol | description                   |
   | /      | diagonal hatching             |
   | \      | back diagonal                 |
   | \vert  | vertical                      |
   | -      | horizontal                    |
   | +      | crossed                       |
   | x      | crossed diagonal              |
   | o      | small circle                  |
   | O      | large circle (upper-case 'o') |
   | .      | dots                          |
   | *      | stars                         |

   Letters can be combined, in which case all the specified hatchings are done.
   Repeating a character increases the density of hatching of that pattern.

** Property Cycles
   In case you haven't noticed, when you *do multiple plot calls in the same
   axes* -- and not specify any colors -- *the color for each plot is
   different*! The default style in Matplotlib will ~cycle~ through ~a list of
   colors~ if you don't specify any. This feature has been in Matplotlib for a
   long time and it is similar to Matlab behavior.

In v1.5, this feature was extended so that *one can cycle through other
properties besides just color*. Now, you *can cycle linestyles, markers, hatch
styles* -- just about any property that can be specified is now possible to be
cycled.

This feature is still being refined, and there has been significant improvements
in its usability since v1.5, but here is a basic example that will work for v2.0
or greater (for v1.5, you may need to have this cycler expression quoted).


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer

** Transforms
   The topic of transforms in Matplotlib, that is the ability to ~map the
   coordinates~ specified by ~your data~ to the ~coordinates~ of ~your figure~,
   is very advanced and will not be covered in this tutorial. For those who are
   interested in learning about them, see the transformation tutorial. For those
   who are really daring, there are the developer guides to transforms and
   scales. While most users will never, ever need to understand Matplotlib
   transforms to the level described in those links, it is important to be aware
   of them, and their critical role in figure-making.

   In a figure, there are *four coordinate systems*: *display, figure, axes, and
   data*. ~Transforms are used to convert coordinates in one system into another
   system for various uses~. This is how Matplotlib knows exactly where to place
   the ticks and ticklabels, even when you change the axis limits. The ticker
   says that the tick and label "1.5", for example, are to go at data
   x-coordinate 1.5. The transform says that location is at 0.4 in axes
   x-coordinate space. Meanwhile, the xlabel of "Distance" is placed at axes
   x-coordinate space of 0.5 (half-way). Meanwhile, a legend might be placed at
   a location relative to the figure coordinates.

   Furthermore, the transform system is what is used to allow various scales to
   work, such as log scales. The transform system is what is used to make the polar
   plots work seamlessly. Whether you realize it or not, you use the transforms
   system in Matplotlib all the time. Everything drawn in Matplotlib has a
   transform associated with it. Most of the time, you will never notice this, and
   will happily operate within the data coordinate system. But when you want to do
   some more advanced plots, with some eye-catching visual tricks, the transform
   system will be there for you.

** Managing all default settings -- Introducing matplotlibrc
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   *matplotlibrc file store all default settings in dict-manner*

   "This color is blue by *default*"
   "This ~plt.plot~ is draw on current axes by *default*"
   "This ..... by *default*"

   ~mpl.rc('lines', linewidth=2, linestyle='-.') # <- change matplotlibrc at runtime~
   #+END_QUOTE

   Matplotlib's *greatest strength* is its ability to give you ~complete control
   over every single aspect of your plots and figures~. Matplotlib's *second
   greatest strength* is its ability to take as much control over as much of
   your plots and figures as you want. You, as the user, would never consider to
   use Matplotlib if you had to specify all of these things for every single
   plot. Most of the time, ~the defaults~ are exactly what you want them to be.

Matplotlib uses the ~matplotlibrc configuration file~ to define the plethora of
~defaults~ found in the library. ~You can control the defaults of almost every
property in Matplotlib~:
   - figure size and dpi
   - line width
   - color and style
   - axes
   - axis
   - grid properties
   - text
   - font properties
   - etc.

   Just modify your rc file and re-run your scripts to produce your improved
   figures.

   *seaborn is just a default file, which define a different rc file from the matplotlib*

*** find the current active matplotlibrc file
*To display where the currently active matplotlibrc file was loaded from, one can
do the following*:

  import matplotlib
  print(matplotlib.matplotlib_fname())
#+END_SRC

:RESULTS:
# Out[34]:

*** change the matplotlibrc settings in runtime.
  ~mpl.rc('lines', linewidth=2, linestyle='-.') # <- change matplotlibrc at runtime~
You can also ~change the rc settings during runtime~ within a python script or
interactively from the python shell. All of the ~rc~ settings are stored in a
~dictionary-like variable~ called ~matplotlib.rcParams~, which is *global* to the
matplotlib package. rcParams can be modified directly. Newer versions of
matplotlib can use ~rc()~, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
  import matplotlib as mpl
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  mpl.rcdefaults()  # revert everything back to the built-in defaults settings.

  fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
  ax1.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])

  mpl.rc('lines', linewidth=2, linestyle='-.') # <- change matplotlibrc at runtime
  # Equivalent older, but still valid syntax
  # mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 2
  # mpl.rcParams['lines.linestyle'] = '-.'

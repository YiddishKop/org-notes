* Z scores( standardised scores)
  use them for *comparing two different observations*, from *two different data sets*.
  Z scores represent how far either side of a mean a particular observed value *in unit of standard deviation* in that data set actually is.

  $z=\dfrac{(x - \mu)}\sigma$

** Exercise
*** Exercise 1
Suppose the heights of adult *females* is normally distributed with a *mean of 66* inches and a standard *deviation of 1.75* inches.
Suppose that the heights of adult *males* is normally distributed with a *mean of 70* inches and a standard *deviation of 2.2* inches.
Jill is *70 inches* tall and Jack is *75 inches* tall. *Which person is taller relative to those of their same gender*?

Jill:

$z=\dfrac{(x-\mu)}\sigma=\dfrac{(77-66)}{1.75}=2.29$

Jack:

$z=\dfrac{(x-\mu)}\sigma=\dfrac{(75-70)}{2.2}=2.27$

Relatively speaking, Jill is taller than Jack because her standard score is greater

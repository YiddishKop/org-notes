*** hash-reading-method 读书法
    condition - familiar with content >? 30%
    target    - hold the core concept of text
    interpre  - log the most frequency *one* word in front of note --- *major-core*.
    log the most frequency *2~4* words occur around it --- *minor-cores*.
	log all the *sentences* include words below.
	connect the *chapter-titles* with these *sentences*.
	interpret the *relationship* between chapter-titles and sentences by your current knowledge.
	write the *fake-relationship* down in note.
	readings in detail to find the *true-relationship*.
	compair the true and fake one.
    pin the *true-relationship chapter-titles and major/minor* in your knowledge map.
*** hack emacs
    like org-protocol --- capture content between chrome and emacs-org, I think it is more convinient to hack
    emacs to make has-reading-method apply smoothly.
